ZENODO DESCRIPTION - Cryptocurrency Event Study v2.0.0

WHY INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES CRASH CRYPTO MARKETS 5.7× HARDER THAN REGULATORY CRACKDOWNS

Conventional wisdom says regulatory uncertainty drives cryptocurrency volatility. We prove the opposite: infrastructure events generate 5.7× larger market impacts than regulatory events (2.385% vs 0.419%, p=0.0008, Cohen's d=2.75). This contradicts traditional financial markets where policy matters more than pipes.

The mechanism is architectural: Decentralized protocols resist regulatory enforcement through jurisdictional arbitrage (regulatory interventions remain geographically constrained), while infrastructure failures directly compromise operational integrity with no escape route. Code failures cascade globally—regulations don't.

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS

1. Novel event decomposition methodology: TARCH-X models with GDELT sentiment indices decomposed into regulatory vs infrastructure channels across 50 curated events (2019-2025) and 6 cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, LTC, ADA)

2. Robust statistical validation: Primary finding survives independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U, inverse-variance meta-analysis, Bayesian hypothesis testing (BF>10 for 4/6 assets), machine learning clustering, network spillover analysis, and Markov regime-switching models

3. Unexpected network topology: Ethereum emerges as central systemic risk factor (eigenvector centrality 0.89) over Bitcoin (0.71)—challenges conventional assumptions about market leadership

4. Crisis amplification: Infrastructure effects amplify 5× during crisis periods (COVID-19 crash, FTX collapse), explaining 67% of extreme volatility events despite representing only 18% of sample

5. Practical risk management: Actionable capital buffer recommendations (4-5× higher VaR allocation for infrastructure vs regulatory risk)

WHY THIS MATTERS

For portfolio managers: Infrastructure events require $2-5M VaR increase per $100M portfolio vs $0.5-1M for regulatory events—traditional risk models underweight operational risk by 5×

For regulators: Policy focus should shift from compliance frameworks to operational resilience standards—narrative power without mechanical enforcement in decentralized systems

For market structure: Demonstrates how decentralization fundamentally inverts regulatory effectiveness relative to traditional finance

METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION

Custom quasi-maximum likelihood TARCH-X implementation with unbounded event coefficients (allows negative volatility effects), numerical Hessian robust standard errors, and full model comparison via AIC/BIC (TARCH-X wins 5/6 assets). Manual MLE implementation provides complete control over optimization and constraint relaxation impossible in standard econometric packages.

REPRODUCIBILITY

Full replication package: Python 3.9+, ~45min runtime on standard hardware, no proprietary data. All code, raw data (CoinGecko, GDELT), event classifications, and analysis outputs publicly archived.
