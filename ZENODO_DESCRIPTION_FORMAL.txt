ABSTRACT

This study examines the differential volatility responses of cryptocurrency markets to infrastructure versus regulatory events using TARCH-X models with decomposed GDELT sentiment indices. Analyzing 50 events (2019-2025) across 6 major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, LTC, ADA), we document that infrastructure events generate significantly larger conditional volatility impacts than regulatory events (2.385% vs 0.419%, p=0.0008, Cohen's d=2.753), representing a 5.7× multiplier effect.

This finding contradicts conventional financial market patterns where regulatory uncertainty typically dominates infrastructure concerns. We propose that the mechanism is rooted in cryptocurrency's architectural properties: decentralized protocols enable jurisdictional arbitrage that limits regulatory enforcement effectiveness, while infrastructure failures directly compromise operational integrity with no geographic escape mechanisms.

PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTIONS

(1) Methodological innovation: Development of TARCH-X specifications incorporating event-specific dummy variables and decomposed sentiment channels, estimated via custom quasi-maximum likelihood with unbounded coefficients permitting negative volatility effects.

(2) Robust empirical validation: Primary hypothesis survives multiple statistical tests including independent t-test (t=4.768, p=0.0008), Mann-Whitney U (p=0.0043), inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (Z=3.64, p=0.0003), and Bayesian hypothesis testing (Bayes Factors exceeding 10 for 4 of 6 assets, indicating strong to very strong evidence).

(3) Cross-sectional heterogeneity analysis: Machine learning techniques (k-means clustering, principal component analysis) reveal three distinct response clusters. Network spillover analysis identifies Ethereum as the most systemically central asset (eigenvector centrality 0.89) rather than Bitcoin (0.71), challenging conventional assumptions regarding market leadership.

(4) Crisis regime amplification: Infrastructure volatility effects amplify 5.14× during crisis periods (COVID-19 market disruption, FTX collapse), with crisis periods explaining 67% of extreme volatility events despite representing 18% of the sample period.

(5) Policy implications: Results suggest operational resilience standards merit greater regulatory priority than compliance frameworks, given the limited mechanical enforcement capacity of traditional regulation in decentralized systems.

METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH

The analysis employs three nested volatility specifications estimated via quasi-maximum likelihood: GARCH(1,1), TARCH(1,1) incorporating leverage effects, and TARCH-X augmented with event dummies and decomposed GDELT sentiment indices. The custom implementation relaxes positivity constraints on event coefficients, computed robust standard errors via numerical Hessian, and conducts comprehensive model comparison using information criteria (AIC/BIC). TARCH-X specifications demonstrate superior fit for 5 of 6 assets under AIC, though BIC imposes standard parsimony penalties.

ROBUSTNESS VALIDATION

Beyond primary hypothesis tests, we implement multiple robustness checks: Bayesian posterior inference with informative priors, unsupervised machine learning classification, VAR-based network connectedness decomposition following Diebold-Yilmaz methodology, Markov regime-switching models, and bootstrap resampling (10,000 iterations). Multiple testing corrections apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control at q=0.10. Primary findings remain statistically significant across all specifications.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

For portfolio risk management, infrastructure events require value-at-risk capital buffers 4-5× larger than regulatory events ($2-5M vs $0.5-1M per $100M portfolio). For regulatory policy, results indicate that operational resilience frameworks may generate larger market stability benefits than compliance-focused interventions, given the architectural constraints on regulatory enforcement in decentralized financial systems.
