## Abstract

We document substantial cross-sectional heterogeneity in cryptocurrency event sensitivity, with a 97.4 percentage point spread across tokens (BNB: 0.947% to LTC: -0.027%). Using TARCH-X models on 18 global events (2020-2025), we find infrastructure and regulatory event types produce statistically indistinguishable volatility responses (41.7% vs 41.5%, p=0.997), suggesting token-specific characteristics dominate over event categorization.

## Key Findings

**Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity (97.4 pp spread):**
- BNB: 0.947% | XRP: 0.790% | BTC: 0.475%
- ADA: 0.220% | ETH: 0.092% | LTC: -0.027%

**Event Type Null Result:**
- Infrastructure: 41.7% | Regulatory: 41.5% | p=0.997
- **Token selection matters more than event type**
