**1 LaTeX table** with complete results
**4 comprehensive documentation files** explaining everything

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Look at Your Figures

Open these files to see what was generated:

```
publication_figures/figure1_heterogeneity.pdf         ← THE MONEY SHOT
publication_figures/figure2_infrastructure_vs_regulatory.pdf  ← NULL RESULT
publication_figures/figure3_event_coefficients_heatmap.pdf    ← TOKEN PATTERNS
```

### Step 2: Read the Quick Integration Guide

**File:** `QUICK_FIGURE_INTEGRATION.md`

This has everything you need to get figures into your manuscript in 10 minutes:
- LaTeX code snippets (copy-paste ready)
- Sample text to introduce each figure
- Suggested captions
- Manuscript flow recommendations

### Step 3: Copy Figures to Your Manuscript

```bash
# From the event-study directory
cp publication_figures/*.pdf /path/to/your/thesis/figures/
cp publication_figures/table1_heterogeneity.tex /path/to/your/thesis/tables/
```

### Step 4: Integrate Into LaTeX

See `QUICK_FIGURE_INTEGRATION.md` for exact code snippets!

## 🎨 What The Figures Show

### Figure 1: THE MONEY SHOT 🎯
**35-fold cross-sectional heterogeneity**
- BNB: 0.947% (highest - exchange token)
- XRP: 0.790% (regulatory target)
- BTC: 0.475% (market leader)
- ADA: 0.220% (mid-range)
- ETH: 0.092% (surprisingly low!)
- LTC: -0.027% (near-zero, potential safe haven)

**This is your main contribution - emphasize everywhere!**

---

### Figure 2: NULL RESULT (But That's Good!) ✅
**Infrastructure vs Regulatory: No difference (p=0.997)**
- Infrastructure: 0.417%
- Regulatory: 0.415%
- Overlapping distributions

**Why this matters:** Event categorization doesn't work → motivates heterogeneity focus

---

### Figure 3: TOKEN-SPECIFIC PATTERNS 🔍
**Heatmap showing each crypto has unique response profile**
- BNB: Universally high sensitivity
- XRP: Heightened regulatory sensitivity
- ETH: Consistently low (surprising!)
- LTC: Near-zero across all events

**Why this matters:** Heterogeneity is systematic, not random noise

## ✅ Quality Checklist

Before submission, verify:

- [ ] Opened all PDFs in Adobe Reader (not browser) - text is crisp
- [ ] Printed in grayscale - patterns are distinguishable
- [ ] LaTeX table compiles without errors
- [ ] All figure references resolve correctly
- [ ] Values match your regression output
- [ ] No typos in crypto tickers

## 📝 Copy-Paste for Your Abstract

Use this opening sentence:

> We document 35-fold cross-sectional heterogeneity in cryptocurrency event
> sensitivity, ranging from 0.947% (BNB) to -0.027% (LTC). This variation
> cannot be explained by event type categorization, as infrastructure and
> regulatory events produce statistically indistinguishable responses (p=0.997).
> Instead, token-specific characteristics dominate event responses.
