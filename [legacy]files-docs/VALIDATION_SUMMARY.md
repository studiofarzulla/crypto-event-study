## ‚ö†Ô∏è Items Needing Clarification (Before Submission)

### 1. Model Diagnostics Discrepancy üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue:** Two files with contradictory results

- `model_diagnostics_final.csv`: Shows all models converged with AIC/BIC values
- `model_diagnostics_thesis.csv`: Shows all models failed to converge (Converged=No, AIC=N/A)

**Action Required:**
- Verify which file represents your thesis results
- If thesis file is outdated, delete or rename it to avoid confusion
- Ensure reported values in thesis match `model_diagnostics_final.csv`

### 2. Overlap Adjustment Interpretation üü° **CLARIFY IN METHODOLOGY**

**Current Implementation:**
```
EIP-1559 (D_17) and Poly Network (D_18) overlap on Aug 7-8, 2021
Both dummies set to 0.5 on overlap days
```

**What This Means:**
- Day with dummy=0.5 contributes `0.5 √ó coefficient` to variance
- Total effect on overlap = `0.5√ócoef_17 + 0.5√ócoef_18`
- This assumes **additive but weighted** decomposition

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Max pooling**: `max(D_17, D_18) = 1` (any event present counts as 1)
2. **Full additive**: `D_17 + D_18 = 2` (allows independent full effects)
3. **Current weighted**: `0.5√óD_17 + 0.5√óD_18 = 1` (prevents double-counting)

**Action Required:**
- Add methodological justification for weighted approach
- Explain economic rationale: "Volatility on overlap days attributed equally to both events to prevent double-counting while preserving individual event identification"
- Consider sensitivity check with max pooling

### 3. Numerical Hessian Stability üü° **VERIFY EMPIRICALLY**

**Implementation:** Standard errors via numerical Hessian (finite differences)

**Potential Concern:** Can be numerically unstable for some parameter values

**Action Required:**
- Check for any NaN or extremely large standard errors in results
- Example check from BTC TARCH-X:
  ```
  Infrastructure: coef=0.463, se=0.953 ‚Üí Large but plausible
  Regulatory: coef=0.488, se=0.667 ‚Üí OK
  ```
- If standard errors look reasonable (no NaN, not 100√ó coefficient), you're fine

---

## üìä Results Interpretation Notes

### Hypothesis Testing Results

**From your outputs:**
```
Infrastructure events: mean = 0.417% volatility increase
Regulatory events:     mean = 0.415% volatility increase
Difference: 0.002% (p = 0.997, not significant)
```

**This is an EMPIRICAL FINDING, not a methodology error.** Your hypothesis may not be supported by cryptocurrency market data. Possible explanations:

1. **Hypothesis not supported**: Crypto markets may react similarly to both event types
2. **Heterogeneous effects**: Some coins show infrastructure>regulatory, others show opposite, averaging out
3. **Statistical power**: 50 events across 6 coins may not provide sufficient power
4. **Event classification**: Regulatory/Infrastructure distinction may not capture volatility-relevant differences
5. **Market efficiency**: Crypto markets may price events similarly regardless of source

**Recommendation:** Frame as "empirical investigation" rather than "hypothesis confirmation study"

### FDR Correction Impact

**Most individual event coefficients become non-significant after FDR correction:**
```
BNB Infrastructure: p=0.022 ‚Üí FDR p=0.259 (not significant after correction)
```

**This is CORRECT behavior** with ~300 hypothesis tests (50 events √ó 6 cryptos). It indicates:
- Proper control of family-wise error rate
- Individual effects may be noisy
- Consider inverse-variance weighted results (already implemented in your code)

## üéØ Pre-Submission Checklist

### Critical (Do Before Submission)

- [ ] **Resolve diagnostic file discrepancy** (thesis vs final)
- [ ] **Verify Hessian stability** (no NaN or extreme standard errors)
- [ ] **Document overlap adjustment** rationale in methodology section
- [ ] **Check AIC/BIC values** in thesis match model_diagnostics_final.csv

### Recommended (Strengthen Results Section)

- [ ] **Report inverse-variance weighted results** (already computed in analysis_results/)
- [ ] **Discuss statistical power** given 50 events, 6 cryptocurrencies
- [ ] **Explain non-significant H1 result** economically (not a failure, an empirical finding)
- [ ] **Cross-reference all tables** in thesis with CSV outputs

### Optional (If Time Permits)

- [ ] **Bootstrap coverage check**: Verify 95% CIs cover true parameters ~95% of time
- [ ] **Sensitivity analysis**: Try max-pooling for overlapping events
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Add basic tests for event window creation

## üí° Strengths of Your Implementation

1. **Manual TARCH-X implementation**: Shows deep understanding; arch package can't do variance-equation exogenous variables
2. **Comprehensive special event handling**: Three cases all handled correctly with clear documentation
3. **Rigorous multiple testing correction**: FDR properly applied to control Type I errors
4. **Four independent robustness checks**: OHLC (real data!), placebo (actual models!), winsorization, window sensitivity
5. **Timezone consistency**: UTC enforcement prevents subtle alignment bugs
6. **Clear code documentation**: Methodology references, inline explanations, docstrings throughout
7. **Reproducibility**: Config file, random seeds, relative paths, environment variables

## üö® One Red Flag to Address

**Model diagnostics discrepancy is the only critical issue.** Everything else is either correct or needs minor documentation clarification.

If `model_diagnostics_thesis.csv` represents your reported results, and those models actually failed to converge, that's a major problem. If it's just an outdated file from early testing, rename it to `model_diagnostics_OLD.csv` to avoid confusion.

**Verify your thesis reports values from `model_diagnostics_final.csv`** which shows all models converged successfully.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Your methodology is sound and correctly implemented.** Address the model diagnostics discrepancy, document the overlap adjustment rationale, verify Hessian stability, and you're ready to submit. The non-significant H1 result is an empirical finding that requires economic interpretation, not a flaw in your analysis.

**Estimated time to address critical items:** 2-3 hours
**Confidence level in methodology:** 95% (very high)
