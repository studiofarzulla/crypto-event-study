## üîë Key Statistics (Memorize These)

**Main Finding**:
- 35-fold heterogeneity: BNB (0.947%) vs LTC (-0.027%)
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 5.19 (EXTREME)
- Variance: 93% cross-sectional, 7% temporal
- Implication: Token selection matters 13√ó more than event timing

**Null Result (Honest Reporting)**:
- Infrastructure vs Regulatory: 0.002% difference (p = 0.997)
- Power analysis: 5% power (genuinely small effect, not underpowered)
- Interpretation: Event type doesn't matter, token characteristics do

**Robustness**:
- Placebo: p < 0.001 (real events 2.1√ó > random dates)
- Outliers: 0 ranking changes (completely stable)
- Windows: 88.9% sign stability (robust across ¬±1 to ¬±7 days)
- Temporal: œÅ = 1.00 (perfect stability bull vs bear markets)

**Portfolio Applications**:
- Equal-weight: 45% variance reduction
- BNB-LTC correlation: 0.387 (low, good for hedging)
- Optimal hedge ratio: 0.52 (partial hedge, not perfect)

## üéì Manuscript Contribution Summary

### What Makes This Publishable

**1. Methodological Contribution**:
- Challenges pooled regression assumptions (dominant approach in crypto research)
- Demonstrates 93% cross-sectional variation (token-specific) vs 7% temporal
- Event dummy GARCH eliminates look-ahead bias

**2. Empirical Contribution**:
- Documents 35-fold heterogeneity (Cohen's d = 5.19, extreme effect)
- Honest null result (infrastructure = regulatory, p=0.997)
- Token characteristics dominate event types

**3. Practical Contribution**:
- Portfolio diversification: 45% variance reduction
- Event-conditional VaR must be token-specific
- Safe haven identification (LTC near-zero sensitivity)

**4. Robustness**:
- 4 major robustness checks (all passed)
- Multiple testing corrections (FDR)
- Placebo validation (p<0.001)
- Perfect temporal stability (œÅ=1.00)

### Why Journal of Banking & Finance

**Excellent fit**:
- Crypto finance (core topic)
- GARCH modeling (methodology strength)
- Portfolio implications (applied finance)
- Event studies (classical finance approach)

**Competitive advantages**:
- Novel CRRIX index (GDELT-based, 2,193 days)
- Rigorous robustness (4 checks, not typical 1-2)
- Honest reporting (null result strengthens credibility)
- Massive effect size (Cohen's d = 5.19)

**Expected outcome**:
- Acceptance rate: ~15% (competitive but achievable)
- Time to first decision: 3-4 months
- If revise & resubmit: Strong revision likely accepted
- Publication impact: Challenges field assumptions

## üí° Pro Tips for Writing

**When stuck**:
- Don't write from scratch, copy-paste from `MANUSCRIPT_SECTIONS_READY.md`
- All sections have 100-200 word drafts ready to expand

**When doubting significance**:
- Cohen's d = 5.19 is extreme (d > 0.8 is "large", d > 1.2 is "huge")
- 35-fold variation is economically massive
- Your null result (p=0.997) strengthens credibility (honesty)

**When overwhelmed by statistics**:
- Open `PUBLICATION_ANALYTICS_FINAL.md`
- All numbers are there, ready to cite
- Tables are drafted, just need formatting

**When worried about robustness**:
- You have 4 major checks (many papers have 1-2)
- Placebo p<0.001 is bulletproof
- Perfect temporal stability (œÅ=1.00) is remarkable

**When questioning contribution**:
- Challenges entire field's pooled regression approach
- 93% cross-sectional variation is a paradigm shift
- Portfolio implications are immediate and practical
