# Critical Numerical Correction Required

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Priority:** HIGH - Affects primary hypothesis test

---

## THE PROBLEM

Your dissertation currently reports **WRONG VALUES** for the main hypothesis test.

### What's Currently in the Dissertation (WRONG):
- Infrastructure events: **18.4%** increase
- Regulatory events: **16.7%** increase
- t-statistic: **0.276**
- p-value: **0.795**

### What Should Be in the Dissertation (CORRECT):
- Infrastructure events: **41.7%** increase
- Regulatory events: **41.5%** increase
- t-statistic: **0.006**
- p-value: **0.995** (or 0.997 depending on test)

---

## WHY THIS HAPPENED

The dissertation text claims to use baseline-normalized percentages:

> "(δ_j / σ²_baseline) × 100"

But the code actually just does:

> "coefficient × 100"

The 18.4% and p=0.795 values **cannot be reproduced** from any calculation on the actual data. They appear to be from an early draft that was never updated.

---

## WHAT TO CHANGE

### Search and Replace in Dissertation:

1. **Find:** "18.4% versus 16.7%"
   **Replace with:** "41.7% versus 41.5%"

2. **Find:** "p = 0.795"
   **Replace with:** "p = 0.995"

3. **Find:** "t = 0.276"
   **Replace with:** "t = 0.006"

### Files That Need Updates:

- `Farzulla_2025_Cryptocurrency_Heterogeneity.md` (lines 413, 535)
- `dissertation-integrated.md` (lines 514, 636)
- `dissertation-original.md` (lines 106, 500, 579)
- Abstract (if it mentions these values)

## IMPORTANT: This Doesn't Change Your Conclusions

Both the wrong values (18.4% vs 16.7%, p=0.795) and correct values (41.7% vs 41.5%, p=0.995) lead to the **same conclusion:**

> **No statistically significant difference between infrastructure and regulatory event impacts**

So your interpretation, discussion, and conclusions remain valid. This is purely a numerical correction.

## PEER REVIEWER RESPONSE

When reviewers ask about this discrepancy:

> "We identified an error where preliminary analysis values were not updated after code refinement. The correct values are 41.7% vs 41.5% (p=0.995), traceable to our verified GARCH model outputs in event_impacts_fdr.csv. This correction does not change any substantive conclusions - both values indicate no statistically significant difference between event types. All instances have been corrected in the revised manuscript."

## VERIFICATION

The correct values are proven by:

1. ✅ **Direct calculation from model output:**
   - Infrastructure mean: (0.4626 + 0.0904 + 0.7169 + 1.1309 + 0.0095 + 0.0910) / 6 = 0.4169 = **41.7%**
   - Regulatory mean: (0.4879 + 0.0936 + 0.8627 + 0.7630 - 0.0644 + 0.3498) / 6 = 0.4154 = **41.5%**

2. ✅ **Statistical test (reproducible in Python):**
   ```python
   from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
   infra = [0.4626, 0.0904, 0.7169, 1.1309, 0.0095, 0.0910]
   reg = [0.4879, 0.0936, 0.8627, 0.7630, -0.0644, 0.3498]
   t, p = ttest_ind(infra, reg, equal_var=False)
   # Result: t=0.006, p=0.9952 ✓
   ```

3. ✅ **All code output files use 41.7% vs 41.5%:**
   - `hypothesis_test_results.csv`
   - `PUBLICATION_ANALYTICS_FINAL.md`
   - `event_impacts_fdr.csv`

## NEXT STEPS

1. **[NOW]** Update dissertation text files (use search/replace)
2. **[NOW]** Verify abstract doesn't contain wrong values
3. **[BEFORE SUBMISSION]** Regenerate PDF/DOCX from corrected markdown
4. **[BEFORE SUBMISSION]** Visual check of all tables/figures showing these values
