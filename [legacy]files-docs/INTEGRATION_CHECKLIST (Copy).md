## COMMON ISSUES AND FIXES

### Issue: Section 6 didn't renumber after adding 5.5
**Fix:** Manually update section number, or use automatic numbering

### Issue: Correlation matrix table won't paste correctly
**Fix:** Create blank table in Word first, then paste cell-by-cell

### Issue: Special characters (ρ, ±) not displaying
**Fix:** Use Insert → Symbol, or copy from character map

### Issue: References not in alphabetical order
**Fix:** Manually sort, or use citation manager

### Issue: Formatting inconsistent after paste
**Fix:** Paste as plain text (Ctrl+Shift+V), then reformat
