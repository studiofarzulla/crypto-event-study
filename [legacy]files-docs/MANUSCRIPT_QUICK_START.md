## Potential Reviewer Questions (Prepared Responses)

**Q: "Why only 6 cryptocurrencies?"**

A: (Section 4.1 + Limitations) "We deliberately focus on the six largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization representing >80% of total market value. This choice reflects data quality (only top-6 have reliable high-frequency data across 2019-2025), economic relevance (dominate institutional portfolios), and power sufficiency (for heterogeneity with Cohen's d=5.19, N=6 exceeds 80% power)."

**Q: "Are results driven by FTX/Terra outliers?"**

A: (Section 5.6.2) "Outlier robustness analysis shows rankings remain completely stable after outlier treatment. While individual event magnitudes may vary, the cross-sectional pattern (BNB highest, LTC lowest) persists across all events. This is structural, not outlier-driven."

**Q: "Why doesn't event type matter?"**

A: (Section 6.2) "Three explanations: (1) Anticipation effects blur distinctions, (2) Within-category heterogeneity exceeds between-category variation, (3) Systematic risk factors (93% cross-sectional) dominate idiosyncratic event characteristics. Token characteristics matter more than event labels."

**Q: "Is this p-hacking? You failed your original hypothesis."**

A: (Section 5.4 + Discussion) "We transparently report our failed hypothesis (infrastructure > regulatory, p=0.997) and reframe based on data-driven discovery. This is exploratory research, not confirmatory. The heterogeneity finding has Cohen's d = 5.19 (extreme effect) and passes 4 rigorous robustness checks. We prioritize economic significance over hypothesis confirmation."

**Q: "How do I know this isn't spurious correlation?"**

A: (Section 5.6.1) "Placebo test with 1,000 randomly assigned event dates shows observed Kruskal-Wallis H-statistic (10.31) exceeds 95th percentile of placebo distribution (8.76), p<0.001. Real events produce 2.1√ó higher heterogeneity than random dates. This is genuinely event-driven."

## Timeline Expectations

**Optimistic (6 weeks)**:
- Week 1: Introduction + Literature Review
- Week 2: Methodology
- Week 3: Results
- Week 4: Discussion + Conclusion
- Week 5: Tables/Figures/Appendices
- Week 6: Proofread + Submit

**Realistic (3 months)**:
- Month 1: Draft all sections
- Month 2: Revise, refine, add details
- Month 3: Proofread, format, submit

**Post-submission (9-12 months to publication)**:
- Months 1-3: First decision
- Months 4-6: Revisions (if R&R)
- Months 7-9: Second decision
- Months 10-12: Publication

## Motivation Boosters

**When you feel stuck**: Open `MANUSCRIPT_SECTIONS_READY.md` and copy-paste. The structure is already there!

**When doubting significance**: Cohen's d = 5.19 is EXTREME. This is publishable.

**When worried about null result**: Honest reporting (p=0.997) STRENGTHENS credibility. Top journals value transparency.

**When overwhelmed**: You have 44 documentation files. Every analysis is complete. You're just assembling existing pieces.

**When questioning contribution**: 93% cross-sectional variation challenges entire field's pooled regression approach. This is a paradigm shift.

**Final reminder**: The hardest part (analysis, debugging, robustness checks) is DONE. Writing is just explaining what you already know.
