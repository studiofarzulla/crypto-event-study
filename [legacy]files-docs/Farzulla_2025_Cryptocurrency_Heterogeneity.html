Cryptocurrency Event Sensitivity: Evidence from TARCH-X Models</h1>
<p><strong>Murad Farzulla</strong> King’s Business School, King’s
College London</p>
<p><em>October 2025</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="abstract"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>This study examines cross-sectional heterogeneity in cryptocurrency
volatility responses to major market events using TARCH-X models across
six leading cryptocurrencies (2019-2025). Contrary to the hypothesis
that event types (infrastructure vs regulatory) drive differential
impacts, we find no statistical difference between categories (p=0.997).
Instead, we document extreme cross-sectional heterogeneity: event
sensitivity varies 35-fold from BNB (0.947%) to LTC (-0.027%), with 93%
of response variation attributable to token-specific characteristics.
Exchange tokens and regulatory litigation targets exhibit significantly
higher event sensitivity (Cohen’s d = 5.19).</p>
<p>Robustness checks validate these findings across multiple dimensions:
placebo tests with 1,000 random event dates confirm heterogeneity is
genuinely event-driven (p&lt;0.001); alternative event windows (±1 to ±7
days) preserve rankings (Spearman ρ &gt; 0.85); temporal stability
analysis reveals perfect rank correlation across bull and bear markets
(ρ = 1.00). Corrected correlation analysis demonstrates substantial
portfolio diversification benefits, with equal-weight portfolios
achieving 45% variance reduction.</p>
<p>Our findings challenge pooled regression approaches common in
cryptocurrency research and demonstrate that token selection matters 13
times more than event timing for volatility exposure management.</p>
<p>Model comparisons strongly support TARCH-X improves out-of-sample
forecast errors by 8–15% overall, with reductions up to ~25% during
event windows. However, sentiment variables provide limited incremental
explanatory power beyond discrete event indicators, suggesting that
weekly aggregation may obscure higher-frequency information dynamics.
The extreme persistence parameters indicate that cryptocurrency markets
operate in a distinct volatility regime where discrete shocks become
absorbed into long-memory processes, posing fundamental challenges for
event impact estimation and risk management within traditional
econometric frameworks.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" id="research-question"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> 1.1 Research Question</h2>
<p><strong><em>“Do cryptocurrency markets exhibit differential
information processing mechanisms between regulatory announcements and
operational infrastructure failures, and can news sentiment serve as a
leading indicator of these asymmetric volatility
responses?”</em></strong></p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="research-hypotheses"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> 1.2 Research Hypotheses</h2>
<p><strong><em>Primary Hypothesis (H1):</em></strong>***
******Asymmetric Volatility Response****** - Market
structure/infrastructure events generate significantly larger volatility
impacts than regulatory events due to immediate liquidity disruption
versus gradual information absorption mechanisms.***</p>
<p><strong><em>Secondary Hypothesis (H2):</em></strong>***
******Sentiment Leading Indicator****** - News sentiment (GDELT-derived)
serves as a leading indicator for volatility asymmetries, with
infrastructure events showing immediate sentiment-volatility correlation
versus regulatory events showing lagged responses.***</p>
<p><strong><em>Methodological Hypothesis (H3):</em></strong>***
******TARCH-X Superiority****** - TARCH-X models incorporating sentiment
proxies outperform standard GARCH specifications in capturing asymmetric
volatility responses to different event types in cryptocurrency
markets.***</p>
<p><strong><em>The cryptocurrency market’s transformation from
experimental technology to a three-trillion-dollar asset class has
created unprecedented challenges for understanding information
processing in financial markets (Reuters, 2021). Since Bitcoin’s
inception in 2009, digital assets have developed unique structural
characteristics - continuous 24/7 trading, fragmented exchange
infrastructure, predominantly retail participation, and critical
technological dependencies - that fundamentally distinguish them from
traditional financial markets. These features violate core assumptions
of classical market efficiency theory and necessitate new frameworks for
understanding how different information types are processed and
incorporated into prices (Makarov and Schoar, 2020).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The theoretical foundation for examining differential
information processing in cryptocurrency markets emerges from the
intersection of market microstructure theory and behavioural finance.
While the Efficient Market Hypothesis predicts uniform and instantaneous
price adjustment to all available information, cryptocurrency markets
exhibit systematic deviations from this baseline. Empirical evidence
documents persistent cross-exchange price discrepancies exceeding five
per cent, significant return autocorrelation at high frequencies, and
pronounced asymmetric volatility responses that suggest complex,
non-uniform information processing mechanisms (Urquhart, 2016;
Bariviera, 2017). The dominance of retail investors, who constitute
approximately 80% of trading volume and exhibit stronger behavioural
biases than institutional participants, amplifies sentiment-driven
dynamics and creates conditions for differential processing of various
event types (Auer and Claessens, 2018).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cryptocurrency volatility characteristics provide crucial
insights into these information processing mechanisms. Extensive
research using GARCH-family models establishes that cryptocurrencies
exhibit extreme volatility clustering with persistence parameters
approaching unity, suggesting near-integrated variance processes
(Katsiampa, 2017). Moreover, leverage effects - where negative shocks
generate disproportionately larger volatility increases - are
approximately twice as pronounced as in equity markets, with asymmetry
parameters in threshold models ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 (Baur and
Dimpfl, 2018). Recent methodological advances incorporating exogenous
variables into volatility specifications, particularly TARCH-X models
that combine threshold asymmetry with external information flows,
demonstrate significant improvements in capturing cryptocurrency market
dynamics (Walther et al., 2019).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The integration of sentiment analysis reveals the
critical role of investor attention in cryptocurrency price formation.
Unlike traditional markets where institutional investors dominate price
discovery, cryptocurrency markets show strong retail-driven sentiment
effects. Studies demonstrate that social media sentiment predicts
Bitcoin returns up to 48 hours in advance, whilst news sentiment
extracted from mainstream media shows even stronger relationships,
particularly for negative events (Phillips and Gorse, 2018; Rognone et
al., 2020). The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)
provides unprecedented granularity for constructing thematic sentiment
measures, processing over 100,000 global news sources to enable
decomposition of regulatory versus infrastructure-related coverage, a
capability essential for testing differential information processing
hypotheses (Shen et al., 2019).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Empirical evidence suggests fundamentally different
market responses to regulatory announcements versus infrastructure
failures. Regulatory events - such as government bans, enforcement
actions, or new compliance requirements - typically generate immediate
price declines of 5-15% followed by elevated volatility persisting for
15-30 days, consistent with gradual absorption of legal risk information
(Auer and Claessens, 2018). These events affect valuations through
expectation channels, requiring investors to reassess fundamental value
based on changing legal and operational constraints. The extended
volatility elevation suggests markets require substantial time to fully
process regulatory implications, potentially reflecting the complexity
of interpreting legal language and assessing long-term consequences
(Feinstein and Werbach, 2021).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In contrast, infrastructure failures, including exchange
outages, wallet breaches, and smart contract exploits, create immediate
mechanical disruptions to market functioning. These events generate
volatility spikes of 300-500% above baseline levels that typically decay
within 72-96 hours, suggesting markets treat them as temporary liquidity
shocks rather than fundamental revaluations (Chen et al., 2023). The
emergence of decentralised finance has introduced novel infrastructure
vulnerabilities, with flash loan attacks facilitating over seven billion
dollars in losses since 2020. These attacks, which exploit protocol
composability within single blockchain transactions, represent a
distinct category of operational risk that combines cyber-security
threats with financial engineering vulnerabilities (Qin et al.,
2021).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Despite extensive research on cryptocurrency volatility
and event impacts, critical gaps remain in understanding differential
information processing mechanisms. Existing literature typically
examines regulatory and infrastructure events in isolation using
incompatible methodologies, making direct comparison impossible. Studies
of regulatory events employ traditional event study methods with
extended windows, whilst infrastructure analyses use high-frequency
approaches with short horizons, reflecting untested assumptions about
processing speeds (Corbet et al., 2019). Furthermore, no research has
systematically examined how continuous sentiment flows interact with
discrete event impacts, despite evidence that background sentiment
conditions may moderate market responses through behavioural
channels.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This study addresses these limitations through a unified
analytical framework that enables direct comparison of regulatory and
infrastructure events whilst incorporating both discrete and continuous
information flows. I implement three key methodological innovations.
First, I develop a rigorous event classification taxonomy based on
information transmission channels, distinguishing between
expectation-channel events (regulatory) and mechanical-disruption events
(infrastructure). Second, I construct decomposed GDELT-based sentiment
indices that separate regulatory from infrastructure-related news
coverage, enabling tests of whether thematic sentiment provides
differential predictive power. Third, I employ hierarchical TARCH-X
specifications that progressively incorporate asymmetric effects,
discrete event dummies, and continuous sentiment proxies, allowing
formal testing of whether sentiment augmentation improves volatility
modelling beyond traditional approaches.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This research makes several contributions to
understanding cryptocurrency market dynamics. Theoretically, I test
whether the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency markets, continuous
trading, fragmented liquidity, and retail dominance, enable
sophisticated forms of differential information processing impossible in
traditional markets. Methodologically, I develop a framework for
comparing fundamentally different event types within consistent
econometric specifications whilst controlling for overlapping effects
common in high-frequency cryptocurrency data. Practically, I provide
evidence essential for risk management, with implications for dynamic
hedging strategies if infrastructure events generate predictable mean
reversion patterns versus persistent regulatory effects requiring
longer-term position adjustments.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The implications extend beyond market participants to
regulatory policy design. If regulatory announcements create prolonged
uncertainty exceeding their fundamental impact, authorities might
benefit from clearer forward guidance and phased implementation.
Conversely, if infrastructure failures generate systemic spillovers
through liquidity channels, regulatory focus should prioritise
operational resilience requirements and circuit breaker mechanisms.
Understanding these differential mechanisms becomes increasingly
critical as cryptocurrency markets mature toward greater institutional
participation and regulatory integration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This research proceeds through systematic investigation
of three hypotheses. First, I test whether market infrastructure events
generate significantly larger volatility impacts than regulatory events,
consistent with immediate liquidity disruption versus gradual
information absorption mechanisms. Second, I examine whether news
sentiment serves as a leading indicator for volatility asymmetries, with
infrastructure events showing immediate sentiment-volatility correlation
versus lagged regulatory responses. Third, I evaluate whether TARCH-X
models incorporating sentiment proxies outperform standard GARCH
specifications in capturing asymmetric volatility responses to different
event types.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Through comprehensive empirical analysis spanning six
major cryptocurrencies from January 2019- August 2025, I document
nuanced evidence regarding differential information processing. The
relationship between infrastructure and regulatory events varies
substantially across cryptocurrencies, with infrastructure coefficients
ranging from near-zero (LTC: 0.01) to substantial (BNB: 1.13), whilst
regulatory coefficients demonstrate similar heterogeneity. Aggregate
analysis reveals remarkably similar mean effects between event types
(infrastructure: 0.417, regulatory: 0.415), suggesting market-specific
factors dominate universal patterns. TARCH-X specifications
incorporating decomposed sentiment show modest improvements in model
fit, with information criteria indicating enhanced performance for
specific cryptocurrencies rather than uniform superiority. Notably, only
BNB demonstrates statistically significant infrastructure effects at
conventional levels, though significance diminishes after false
discovery rate correction. These findings challenge assumptions of
uniform information processing mechanisms across cryptocurrency markets
and suggest that asset-specific characteristics, including market
capitalisation, trading volume, and technological architecture, may
determine differential responses to distinct event
categories.</em></strong></p>

id="theoretical-foundations-market-efficiency-and-information-processing-in-digital-asset-markets"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> 2.1 Theoretical Foundations:
Market Efficiency and Information Processing in Digital Asset
Markets</h2>
<p>The theoretical foundation for understanding cryptocurrency market
responses to different event types rests on the intersection of market
microstructure theory, information economics, and behavioural finance.
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), as formulated by Fama (1970),
provides the baseline theoretical expectation that markets should
rapidly incorporate all available information into asset prices. Under
the strong-form EMH, both regulatory information and infrastructure
disruptions would be immediately reflected in prices with no persistent
abnormal volatility effects. However, the unique characteristics of
cryptocurrency markets, including continuous trading, fragmented
exchanges, heterogeneous participant composition, and technological
barriers, create conditions that may fundamentally violate EMH
assumptions and enable differential processing of distinct information
types (Liu and Tsyvinski, 2021).</p>
<p>The theoretical foundation for volatility modelling in financial
markets originates with Engle’s (1982) autoregressive conditional
heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, which first captured the time-varying
nature of financial market volatility. This breakthrough enabled
researchers to model volatility clustering: the empirical observation
that large price changes tend to be followed by large changes, and small
changes by small changes. Bollerslev (1986) generalised this framework
to the GARCH model, which has become the workhorse of volatility
analysis in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH) proposed by Lo (2004) offers a
more nuanced framework for understanding time-varying market efficiency
in cryptocurrency markets. Under the AMH, market efficiency is not a
static property but evolves as market participants learn, adapt, and
develop new trading technologies. This evolutionary perspective is
particularly relevant for understanding how markets might process
regulatory announcements differently from infrastructure failures, as
participants develop distinct heuristics for each event type. Khuntia
and Pattanayak (2018) provide empirical support for the AMH in Bitcoin
markets, finding evidence of time-varying predictability that
corresponds to periods of market stress and regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>The theoretical challenge lies in reconciling these competing
frameworks with the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency markets.
Traditional asset pricing models assume the existence of centralised
market makers, standardised trading mechanisms, and unified regulatory
oversight, assumptions that do not hold in cryptocurrency markets. As
demonstrated by Sockin and Xiong (2022), the decentralised structure of
cryptocurrency platforms creates unique trade-offs between user
protection and network effects that fundamentally alter how different
types of information, regulatory versus operational, are processed and
incorporated into prices.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2"
id="market-microstructure-and-differential-event-processing"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> 2.2 Market Microstructure and
Differential Event Processing</h2>
<p>The market microstructure literature provides crucial insights into
how the unique design features of cryptocurrency markets affect price
discovery and volatility dynamics for different event types. Unlike
traditional markets with designated market makers and centralised order
books, cryptocurrency markets operate through a fragmented landscape of
exchanges with varying degrees of regulatory compliance, liquidity
provision mechanisms, and fee structures (Makarov and Schoar, 2020).
This fragmentation creates conditions where infrastructure failures and
regulatory announcements may propagate through fundamentally different
channels.</p>
<p>Makarov and Schoar (2020) document substantial and persistent
arbitrage opportunities across cryptocurrency exchanges, with price
differences often exceeding 10% and persisting for hours or days. These
findings challenge the standard arbitrage-based arguments for market
efficiency and suggest that limits to arbitrage are particularly severe
in cryptocurrency markets. The authors identify several factors that
constrain arbitrage, including exchange-specific risks, regulatory
uncertainty, and technical barriers to cross-exchange trading. These
frictions may allow infrastructure shocks, which directly impair
arbitrage mechanisms, to create more severe volatility responses than
regulatory announcements that leave trading infrastructure intact.</p>
<p>Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) establish that cryptocurrency returns are
driven by factors specific to cryptocurrency markets rather than
traditional financial market factors. Their comprehensive analysis
reveals that cryptocurrency returns have minimal exposure to stock
market factors, currency movements, or commodity prices, but exhibit
strong sensitivity to cryptocurrency-specific network effects and
momentum factors.</p>
<p>Recent microstructure analysis confirms that cryptocurrency markets
exhibit liquidity and price discovery patterns similar to other
investible asset classes, with predictable cross-market effects
particularly evident between Bitcoin and Ethereum (Easley, O’Hara, and
Yang, 2024, SSRN Working Paper). These findings support the application
of traditional market microstructure theory to cryptocurrency event
studies whilst acknowledging the unique features of decentralised market
architecture.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3"
id="information-processing-behavioural-factors-and-sentiment-dynamics"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> 2.3 Information Processing,
Behavioural Factors, and Sentiment Dynamics</h2>
<p>The role of retail investors and behavioural biases in cryptocurrency
markets has important implications for how different types of events are
processed and how sentiment indicators might predict volatility
responses. Glaser et al. (2014) provide early evidence that
cryptocurrency users are primarily motivated by speculative rather than
transactional considerations, suggesting that price formation in these
markets may be more susceptible to sentiment and herding behaviours than
traditional asset markets, with potentially different responses to
operational versus regulatory threats.</p>
<p>The high degree of retail participation in cryptocurrency markets
creates conditions where noise trading and sentiment-driven behaviour
may dominate fundamental value considerations, particularly during
periods of uncertainty. Da and Huang (2020) demonstrate that
attention-based measures, such as Google search volume, have significant
predictive power for cryptocurrency returns and volatility. This finding
suggests that retail investor attention plays a more prominent role in
cryptocurrency price formation than in traditional markets, potentially
amplifying the impact of salient infrastructure failures whilst causing
more gradual absorption of complex regulatory developments.</p>
<p>The continuous, 24/7 nature of cryptocurrency trading eliminates the
overnight gaps and weekend effects that characterise traditional
markets, creating a continuous price discovery process that may process
different event types at varying speeds. Katsiampa (2017) and Chu et
al. (2017) demonstrate through GARCH modelling that this continuous
trading amplifies volatility clustering and momentum effects. The
absence of traditional market-closing mechanisms and circuit breakers
means that infrastructure shocks can propagate through cryptocurrency
markets without the natural cooling-off periods that exist in
traditional markets, whilst regulatory announcements, often released
during business hours, may be processed more gradually.</p>
<p>The sentiment-volatility nexus provides a critical mechanism for
understanding differential event impacts. Tetlock (2007) established the
foundational relationship between news sentiment and market volatility
in traditional markets, whilst Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016)
demonstrated how news-based indices can capture policy uncertainty
effects. In cryptocurrency markets, sentiment may serve as a leading
indicator that differentiates between event types: infrastructure
failures generate immediate negative sentiment concurrent with
volatility spikes, whilst regulatory announcements may show sentiment
changes that precede volatility adjustments as market participants
gradually process implications.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4"
id="asymmetric-volatility-in-cryptocurrency-markets"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> 2.4 Asymmetric Volatility in
Cryptocurrency Markets</h2>
<p>Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that cryptocurrency
markets exhibit pronounced asymmetric volatility responses, with
negative shocks generating disproportionately larger volatility
increases than positive shocks of equivalent magnitude. Cheikh, Zaied
and Chevallier (2020) document this asymmetry across major
cryptocurrencies using smooth transition GARCH models, whilst Katsiampa
(2017) confirms that asymmetric specifications consistently outperform
symmetric models for Bitcoin volatility.</p>
<p>Nelson (1991) introduced the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model
specifically to address two limitations of standard GARCH models: the
non-negativity constraints on parameters and the symmetric treatment of
shocks. The EGARCH specification allows for unrestricted parameter
estimation whilst capturing the leverage effect through an asymmetric
response function. This methodological advance is particularly relevant
for cryptocurrency markets, where negative news, whether regulatory or
infrastructure-related, often generates disproportionately larger
volatility increases than positive news of equivalent magnitude.</p>
<p>This asymmetry has critical implications for comparing infrastructure
and regulatory events, as both typically manifest as negative market
shocks but may exhibit different persistence characteristics.
Infrastructure failures that directly impair trading mechanisms might
generate immediate, severe volatility spikes with mechanical
persistence. Regulatory announcements, whilst also negative signals, may
produce more gradual volatility increases as market participants
progressively interpret implications.</p>
<p>The incorporation of exogenous variables into asymmetric volatility
models enables decomposition of total volatility into baseline dynamics,
continuous sentiment-driven pressure, and discrete event shocks,
essential for testing whether different event types exhibit distinct
volatility signatures and adjustment patterns.</p>

id="event-studies-in-cryptocurrency-markets-from-price-to-volatility-effects"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5</span> 2.5 Event Studies in
Cryptocurrency Markets: From Price to Volatility Effects</h2>
<p>The empirical literature on event impacts in cryptocurrency markets
has evolved from early studies focusing primarily on price effects to
more sophisticated analyses of volatility dynamics. However, the extant
literature has yet to systematically compare infrastructure and
regulatory events within a unified framework.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.5.1" id="regulatory-event-studies"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> 2.5.1 Regulatory Event
Studies</h3>
<p>Auer and Claessens (2018) provide one of the first comprehensive
analyses of cryptocurrency market reactions to regulatory announcements,
examining 151 regulatory events across multiple jurisdictions. Their
findings reveal heterogeneous responses depending on the type of
regulatory action, with blanket bans generating larger price declines
than targeted regulations. However, their focus on price effects rather
than volatility dynamics limits insights into persistence and adjustment
mechanisms.</p>
<p>Saggu et al. (2025) extend this analysis to examine SEC regulatory
interventions, finding that enforcement actions generate immediate
volatility spikes that typically dissipate within days, whilst
legislative proposals create more prolonged periods of elevated
uncertainty. Their distinction between different regulatory types
provides a framework for understanding gradual information absorption,
but lacks comparison with non-regulatory market disruptions.</p>
<p>Note that Saggu and colleagues have produced two related but distinct
papers on SEC regulatory impacts: Saggu, Ante, and Kopiec (2025) in
Finance Research Letters examining enforcement actions specifically, and
a separate analysis by Ante and Saggu (2025) in Technological
Forecasting and Social Change examining broader regulatory uncertainty
effects.</p>
<p>Chokor and Alfieri (2021) extend this temporal analysis by examining
120 regulatory events across 42 countries, demonstrating that regulatory
impacts exhibit distinct short-term and long-term phases. They find
immediate price declines averaging 3.5% within the first seven days,
followed by persistent volatility elevation lasting up to 30 days for
restrictive regulations. Bonaparte and Bernile (2023) further develop
this framework by constructing a real-time regulatory sentiment index
from news coverage and social media, finding that negative regulatory
sentiment predicts next-day cryptocurrency returns with economic
significance comparable to traditional risk factors. Feinstein and
Werbach (2021) provide crucial theoretical grounding, arguing that
cryptocurrency markets process regulatory information through three
distinct channels: compliance costs, market access restrictions, and
legitimacy signals, each operating on different time horizons.</p>
<p>Zhang et al. (2023) examine the impact of China’s comprehensive
cryptocurrency ban on market volatility, finding that the regulatory
announcement generated immediate volatility increases that persisted for
several weeks. However, their analysis was limited to a single
regulatory event and did not compare regulatory impacts with other types
of market-moving events, highlighting the importance of comparative
approaches.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.5.2"
id="infrastructure-and-market-structure-events"><span
class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> 2.5.2 Infrastructure and
Market Structure Events</h3>
<p>Whilst regulatory events have received significant attention, the
systematic study of infrastructure failures has emerged as a critical
research area. Grobys (2021) provides the first comprehensive analysis
of blockchain hacking events, examining 29 major cryptocurrency exchange
hacks between 2013 and 2020. His findings reveal that hacking events
generate immediate volatility increases of 7-10% that persist for 5-10
trading days, with contagion effects spreading to non-hacked exchanges.
Chen et al. (2023) extend this analysis using high-frequency tick-level
data, documenting that major exchange hacks create immediate liquidity
crises with bid-ask spreads widening by up to 300% and price impacts
exceeding 15% within the first hour.</p>
<p>Milunovich and Lee (2022) employ a high-frequency event study
methodology to compare infrastructure failures with regulatory
announcements, finding that infrastructure events generate volatility
spikes that are 40% larger in magnitude but 60% shorter in duration than
regulatory shocks. Their decomposition of price impacts reveals that
infrastructure failures operate primarily through a liquidity channel
(accounting for 70% of the price effect), whilst regulatory events
operate through an information channel (accounting for 80% of their
effect). This distinction provides empirical support for the hypothesis
that markets process operational and regulatory risks through
fundamentally different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Recent developments in decentralised finance (DeFi) have introduced
novel infrastructure vulnerabilities, including flash loan attacks and
automated market maker failures. Flash loans, which enable
uncollateralised borrowing within single blockchain transactions, have
facilitated over $6.5 billion in exploits since DeFi’s inception
(Saggers et al., 2023). These attacks represent a distinct category of
infrastructure events that can generate immediate liquidity crises and
market disruption, complementing traditional exchange failures in my
event taxonomy.</p>

class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> 2.5.3 Flash Loans and DeFi
Infrastructure Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>The emergence of decentralised finance has introduced novel
infrastructure vulnerabilities that traditional event study
methodologies must adapt to address. Qin et al. (2021) provide the
theoretical foundation for understanding flash loan attacks,
demonstrating how atomic transactions, which either execute completely
or revert entirely, enable risk-free arbitrage opportunities that can
drain hundreds of millions from protocols within single blockchain
blocks. Their analysis of 48 flash loan attacks reveals an average
protocol loss of $3.2 million per incident, with the largest single
attack (Cream Finance) resulting in $130 million in losses.</p>
<p>Gudgeon et al. (2020) develop a comprehensive taxonomy of DeFi attack
vectors, categorising vulnerabilities into: (i) economic attacks
exploiting protocol incentive misalignments, (ii) governance attacks
manipulating voting mechanisms, and (iii) technical attacks exploiting
smart contract bugs. Their framework reveals that 60% of DeFi failures
stem from economic design flaws rather than coding errors, challenging
the conventional focus on technical audits. Zhou et al. (2021) analyse
the market microstructure implications of automated market makers
(AMMs), demonstrating that sandwich attacks, where attackers manipulate
prices before and after user trades, extract over $500 million annually
from DEX users, representing a persistent infrastructure vulnerability
that affects daily price formation.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6"
id="sentiment-indices-and-leading-indicators-in-digital-asset-markets"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6</span> 2.6 Sentiment Indices and
Leading Indicators in Digital Asset Markets</h2>
<p>The development of cryptocurrency-specific sentiment measures has
evolved from adaptations of traditional finance methodologies to novel
approaches leveraging the unique data environment of digital asset
markets. Whilst established indices like the Cryptocurrency Regulatory
Risk Index (CRRIX) by Ni et al. (2021) and the Volatility Cryptocurrency
Index (VCRIX) by Kim et al. (2021) provide validated measures of risk
and uncertainty, data availability constraints and methodological
opacity limit their practical application for comparative event
analysis.</p>
<p>The CRRIX employs machine learning techniques to quantify regulatory
risk from news coverage, finding strong synchronicity between regulatory
uncertainty and market volatility with a one-week lag. The VCRIX
provides a forward-looking volatility measure analogous to the VIX,
using HAR models to forecast expected volatility. Campbell, Lo, and
MacKinlay (1997) provide comprehensive econometric foundations for
constructing and validating such indices, emphasising the importance of
model-free approaches that avoid parametric assumptions about the
underlying return distribution.</p>
<p>Alternative approaches using publicly available data sources offer
greater transparency and flexibility. The Global Database of Events,
Language, and Tone (GDELT) provides standardised sentiment scoring
across millions of news articles, enabling construction of
event-specific sentiment measures. Caferra and Vidal-Tomás (2021)
demonstrate GDELT’s utility for cryptocurrency market analysis, though
existing implementations treat cryptocurrency news monolithically
without distinguishing between event types.</p>
<p>Recent research demonstrates that social media sentiment,
particularly from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, has substantial
predictive power for cryptocurrency returns and volatility. Whilst Liu,
Tsyvinski, and Wu (2022) identify common risk factors in cryptocurrency
returns including network, momentum, and investor attention factors,
studies focusing specifically on social media sentiment analysis have
shown similar predictive power.</p>
<p>The innovation of decomposing sentiment into infrastructure and
regulatory components enables testing whether different event types
exhibit distinct sentiment-volatility relationships. Infrastructure
events, characterised by immediate operational impact, should show
contemporaneous sentiment-volatility correlation. Regulatory events,
requiring interpretation and assessment of long-term implications, may
exhibit lagged relationships as sentiment changes precede full
volatility adjustment.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.7"
id="methodological-considerations-and-identification-challenges"><span
class="header-section-number">3.7</span> 2.7 Methodological
Considerations and Identification Challenges</h2>
<p>The identification of causal effects in cryptocurrency event studies
faces several methodological challenges particularly acute when
comparing different event types. The issue of event endogeneity, where
regulatory actions may be responses to market conditions rather than
exogenous shocks, represents a fundamental threat to causal inference.
Infrastructure events, being typically unexpected system failures, may
offer cleaner identification than regulatory announcements that often
follow periods of market stress.</p>
<p>The problem of confounding events is particularly severe in
cryptocurrency markets, where the high frequency of news and
announcements makes it difficult to isolate specific event effects. The
wide event windows commonly used in cryptocurrency event studies (often
±20 days or more) increase the likelihood of capturing multiple
contemporaneous events, potentially leading to misattribution of
volatility effects. This concern is especially relevant when comparing
events that may cluster differently: infrastructure failures might
trigger regulatory responses, whilst regulatory announcements rarely
cause infrastructure failures.</p>
<p>McWilliams and Siegel (1997) propose solutions to these
identification challenges, including the use of multiple event windows,
cross-sectional regression approaches, and simulation-based inference.
Their framework is particularly relevant for cryptocurrency markets,
where the high correlation amongst digital assets during crisis periods
can amplify both Type I and Type II errors in event attribution. The
application of Benjamini and Hochberg’s (1995) false discovery rate
correction becomes essential when testing multiple hypotheses across
events and assets, controlling the expected proportion of false
rejections amongst all rejections rather than the probability of any
false rejection.</p>
<p>The multiple testing problem arising from examining numerous
asset-event combinations requires careful statistical treatment. Whilst
some studies acknowledge this issue, few implement appropriate
corrections for multiple comparisons, potentially leading to inflated
significance rates. The implementation of False Discovery Rate (FDR)
corrections becomes essential when testing differential effects across
event types and multiple assets.</p>
<p>To date, no study directly compares infrastructure and regulatory
event impacts on volatility using decomposed sentiment indices and
rigorous multiple-testing corrections across a multi-asset sample.</p>

and Data</h2>
<p>The selection of cryptocurrencies balanced statistical power, data
quality, and market representativeness. Following Liu and Tsyvinski
(2021) and Makarov and Schoar (2020), data integrity was prioritised
over sample size. Selection criteria required: (i) continuous trading
throughout January 2019 to August 2025, (ii) sustained top-decile
liquidity, and (iii) distinct market archetypes to capture heterogeneous
event responses.</p>
<p>The final sample comprises six cryptocurrencies:</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) – market baseline and systematic risk factor (Bouri et

<p>Ethereum (ETH) – smart contract platform capturing DeFi
infrastructure exposure</p>
<p>XRP – regulatory case study given SEC litigation (2020-2025),

<p>Binance Coin (BNB) – exchange token representing centralisation

<p>Litecoin (LTC) – control asset with high BTC correlation (0.61-0.75)
for difference-in-differences estimation</p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) – alternative proof-of-stake implementation contrasting
Ethereum’s model</p>
<p>Price and volume data are sourced from CoinGecko’s institutional API,
representing volume-weighted averages across major exchanges at 00:00:00

including the 2020-2021 bull market, 2022 contagion crisis, and
2023-2025 regulatory normalisation. It should be noted that several
prominent assets were excluded for the following rationale: Solana
(network outages), Monero (exchange delistings), Uniswap (insufficient
pre-2020 history), stablecoins (price-pegging mechanisms), and meme
tokens (social sentiment-driven pricing). These exclusions prioritise
continuous data availability over market coverage.</p>
<p>This selection provides sufficient cross-sectional variation whilst
maintaining data quality standards essential for GARCH estimation. Daily
closing prices are sourced from CoinGecko’s institutional API at
00:00:00 UTC, with logarithmic returns calculated as r_t =

<h2 data-number="4.2" id="event-selection-and-classification"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> 3.2 Event Selection and
Classification</h2>
<h3 data-number="4.2.1" id="event-identification"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> 3.2.1 Event
Identification</h3>
<p>Event identification followed a systematic protocol drawing from
primary regulatory documents, exchange/network announcements, and
corroborating news sources spanning January 2019 to August 2025. From an
initial corpus of 208 candidates, I applied three filters: (i) precise
UTC timestamps, (ii) verifiable public records, and (iii) demonstrable
market-wide price impact.</p>
<p>To address confounding from proximate events, a two-stage protocol
was implemented. Events within ±3 days were consolidated if
substantively related, with timing anchored at first disclosure.
Unrelated overlapping events were prioritised by legal finality or
technical severity, with dominated events retained for robustness
checks. This process yielded 50 distinct events (note: some events were
included to increase statistical power and to fill otherwise empty
period.).</p>
<p>Events were selected based on consensus across multiple independent
analyses, with final inclusion requiring appearance in at least 3 of 5
separate event compilations. Each analysis was creating a compilation of
given set of events to include in the final analysis as well as the
classification of each event in accordance to the outlined methodology
above.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.2.2" id="classification-framework"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> 3.2.2 Classification
Framework</h3>
<p>Events were classified into two categories based on their market
mechanism:</p>
<p>Infrastructure events (n=27): Incidents affecting transaction or
settlement mechanics, including exchange outages, chain halts, protocol
exploits, consensus changes, and halvings. The classification criterion
is mechanical impact on execution/settlement, regardless of
predictability. Scheduled upgrades (e.g., Ethereum Merge, Bitcoin
halvings) are classified as infrastructure due to their operational
impact.</p>
<p>Regulatory events (n=23): Legal or supervisory actions that alter the
informational environment whilst preserving trading mechanics, including
enforcement actions, ETF approvals, legislative frameworks. These affect
valuation through legal risk and compliance cost channels rather than
operational disruption.</p>
<p>Classification followed a decision tree: (1) If normal
execution/settlement mechanisms were impaired → Infrastructure; (2) If
impact operated through legal/informational channels → Regulatory.
Boundary cases were resolved by proximate mechanism.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.2.3" id="overlap-treatment"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> 3.2.3 Overlap Treatment</h3>
<p>With [-3,+3] event windows, any events within 6 days produce
overlaps. After consolidation, three pairs required special
treatment:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>SEC v Binance (June 5) and SEC v Coinbase (June 6, 2023): Treated
as a single regulatory episode with composite dummy D_SEC_enforcement
for [June 2 to 9], recognising coordinated enforcement action.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethereum EIP-1559 (Aug 5) and Poly Network hack (Aug 10, 2021):
Retained as separate events with proportional weighting (0.5) during
overlap period [Aug 7 to 8] to prevent double-counting whilst preserving
distinct shock identification, acknowledging this approach treats
overlapping days as equally attributable to both events.</p></li>
<li><p>Bybit hack (Feb 21) and SEC-Coinbase dismissal (Feb 27, 2025):
Cross-channel events handled through truncated windows, with Bybit [Feb
18 to 23], SEC dismissal [Feb 27 to Mar 2], and intervening days
excluded.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 data-number="4.2.4" id="final-event-distribution"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> 3.2.4 Final Event
Distribution</h3>
<p>The final sample of 50 events maintains temporal spacing and category
balance across the study period.</p>
<p>This approach balances comprehensive coverage with econometric
tractability, providing sufficient variation to identify differential
volatility responses whilst maintaining clear event windows for causal
inference.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="gdelt-based-sentiment-proxy"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> 3.3 GDELT-Based Sentiment
Proxy</h2>
<h3 data-number="4.3.1" id="methodological-foundation"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> 3.3.1 Methodological
Foundation</h3>
<p>I construct cryptocurrency sentiment indices using the Global
Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), extending the news-based
sentiment framework of Tetlock (2007) and Baker et al. (2016). GDELT
provides standardised tone scoring across millions of global news
articles, ensuring replicability. Whilst prior studies treat
cryptocurrency news as monolithic (Caferra &amp; Vidal-Tomás, 2021), I
decompose sentiment into regulatory and infrastructure components to
capture distinct market information channels.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.3.2" id="index-construction"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> 3.3.2 Index Construction</h3>
<p>The methodology employs a three-stage process:</p>
<p>Stage 1: Query Specification. I implement hierarchical keyword
matching using GDELT’s structured theme taxonomy:</p>
<p>Primary terms: ‘bitcoin’, ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘ethereum’ plus theme
codes (e.g., ‘ECON_BITCOIN’)</p>
<p>Regulatory identifiers: Policy theme codes (‘EPU_CATS_REGULATION’,
‘EPU_CATS_FINANCIAL_REGULATION’) requiring cryptocurrency
co-occurrence</p>
<p>Infrastructure markers: Crisis taxonomy codes (‘ECON_BANKRUPTCY’,
‘CYBER_ATTACK’, ‘MANMADE_DISASTER’) with cryptocurrency context</p>
<p>This approach yields average weekly coverage of 26.7% for regulatory
and 26.5% for infrastructure content, capturing both discrete events and
persistent thematic discourse across 348 weekly observations. Weekly
aggregation balances computational efficiency with analytical validity
by smoothing daily noise (Huang et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Stage 2: Aggregation and Normalisation. Raw tone scores are
volume-weighted:</p>
<p>S_t^raw = Σ(Tone_i × NumMentions_i) / Σ(NumMentions_i)</p>
<p>Following Manela and Moreira (2017), I apply recursive detrending via
z-score transformation:</p>
<p>S_t = (S_t^raw - μ_t) / σ_t</p>
<p>Using 52-week rolling windows with 26-week initialisation yields 323
usable observations, isolating abnormal sentiment from secular
trends.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Theme Decomposition. Rather than calculating separate
indices from disjoint article sets, I decompose normalised aggregate
sentiment by topical proportions:</p>
<p>S_t^REG = S_t × (p_t^REG) S_t^INFRA = S_t × (p_t^INFRA)</p>
<p>Where proportions represent weekly article fractions matching
respective keywords. This ensures complete data coverage whilst
providing intuitive interpretation: each component represents its
contribution to abnormal sentiment. Mathematical validity was verified
computationally across all observations.</p>
<p>3.3.3 Limitations</p>
<p>Several constraints affect the sentiment measures. GDELT’s
dictionary-based scoring captures journalistic framing rather than
market sentiment; crisis reporting may register neutral whilst “justice
served” narratives generate positive scores. The English-language bias
underrepresents Asian market sentiment. Weekly aggregation may obscure
intra-week dynamics during rapidly evolving events. The decomposition
assumes sentiment scales proportionally with coverage, potentially
misrepresenting events where tone and coverage diverge. Despite these
limitations, temporal alignment with known events and theoretical
consistency of coverage proportions support the approach’s validity for
capturing broad sentiment dynamics in cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.4" id="volatility-modelling-framework"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4</span> 3.4 Volatility Modelling
Framework</h2>
<h3 data-number="4.4.1" id="model-specifications"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> 3.4.1 Model
Specifications</h3>
<p>I employ three nested GARCH specifications to examine cryptocurrency
volatility dynamics, progressing from symmetric to asymmetric models
with exogenous variables:</p>
<p>Model 1: GARCH(1,1) Baseline</p>
<p>σ²_t = ω + α₁ε²_{t-1} + β₁σ²_{t-1}</p>
<p>This baseline specification captures volatility clustering but
assumes symmetric responses to positive and negative shocks.</p>
<p>Model 2: TARCH(1,1)</p>
<p>σ²_t = ω + α₁ε²_{t-1} + γ₁ε²_{t-1}I(ε_{t-1}&lt;0) + β₁σ²_{t-1}</p>
<p>The TARCH specification (Glosten et al., 1993) introduces leverage
parameter γ₁ to capture asymmetric volatility responses, where
I(ε_(t-1)&lt;0) equals one for negative returns. This addresses
documented asymmetries in cryptocurrency markets (Katsiampa, 2017;
Cheikh et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Model 3: TARCH-X with Event Dummies and Sentiment</p>
<p>σ²_t = ω + α₁ε²_{t-1} + γ₁ε²_{t-1}I(ε_{t-1}&lt;0) + β₁σ²_{t-1} +
Σδ_jD_{j,t} + θ₁S_t^REG + θ₂S_t^INFRA</p>
<p>The extended specification incorporates: (i) continuous sentiment
proxies S_t^REG and S_t^INFRA from GDELT decomposition, and (ii) event
dummy variables D_(j,t) activated during [-3,+3] windows. This dual
approach decomposes volatility into baseline dynamics, continuous
sentiment effects, and discrete event shocks.</p>
<p>Due to limitations in existing econometric software for implementing
exogenous variables in GARCH variance equations, I developed a custom
maximum likelihood estimator. This approach ensures precise
implementation of my theoretical specification where σ²_t = baseline +
events + sentiment with D_{j,t} representing event dummies and sentiment
variables. The manual implementation provides full control over the
optimisation process, transparent likelihood function specification, and
proper computation of robust standard errors via numerical Hessian. This
methodological choice demonstrates academic rigour whilst ensuring
reproducibility and avoiding approximations that could compromise the
validity of my asymmetric volatility analysis.</p>
<p>All models employ Student-t distributed innovations to accommodate
heavy tails documented in cryptocurrency returns (Conrad et al., 2018).
This specification follows Nelson’s (1991) recommendation for modelling
financial time series with non-normal innovations, as the Student-t
distribution’s shape parameter can be estimated from the data to capture
the precise degree of tail heaviness. Parameters are estimated via
quasi-maximum likelihood (QMLE) with robust standard errors.</p>
<p>Event coefficients (δ_j) in the TARCH-X specification represent
linear additions to conditional variance rather than multiplicative or
log-variance effects. Specifically, during event periods, the
conditional variance becomes σ²_t = baseline + δ_j where δ_j captures
the absolute increase in variance (in squared percentage points).
Economic interpretation of event effects therefore follows: a
coefficient of δ_j = 0.5 indicates the event increases daily conditional
variance by 0.5 squared percentage points. To express this as a relative
increase, I calculate (δ_j / σ²_baseline) × 100, where σ²_baseline
represents average pre-event conditional variance. This approach
maintains consistency with the linear variance specification whilst
providing economically meaningful effect magnitudes.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.4.2" id="event-window-specification"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> 3.4.2 Event Window
Specification</h3>
<p>Event dummies equal one during [t-3, t+3] windows around event dates,
with special handling for overlapping events as detailed in Section
3.2.3. For infrastructure events, I test whether mechanical disruptions
generate persistent volatility increases. For regulatory events, I
examine whether informational shocks produce temporary or sustained
effects. Primary outcomes measure average volatility change during [t=0,
t+2].</p>
<h3 data-number="4.4.3" id="statistical-inference"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> 3.4.3 Statistical
Inference</h3>
<p>Given non-standard distributional properties of cryptocurrency
returns, I implement bootstrap inference following Pascual et
al. (2006):</p>
<p>Estimate models on original data</p>
<p>Generate 1,000 bootstrap samples via residual resampling</p>
<p>Re-estimate parameters for each sample</p>
<p>Construct percentile confidence intervals</p>
<p>This approach preserves temporal dependence whilst accommodating
heavy tails and potential structural breaks around events. Standard
errors are clustered by event date to account for cross-sectional
correlation during market stress periods.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.4.4" id="model-diagnostics"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> 3.4.4 Model Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Model adequacy is assessed through:</p>
<p>Ljung-Box Q-statistics on standardised and squared standardised
residuals (testing for remaining autocorrelation)</p>
<p>ARCH-LM tests for residual heteroskedasticity</p>
<p>Sign bias tests (Engle &amp; Ng, 1993) confirming asymmetric effects
are captured</p>
<p>Information criteria (AIC, BIC) for model comparison</p>
<p>Cross-asset effects are summarised using inverse-variance weighted
averages of event coefficients. Primary outcomes focus on average
conditional variance changes at t=[0,+2], with secondary analyses
examining persistence and cross-asset patterns.</p>
<p>Event volatility impacts are calculated as: Impact =
(σ²_event/σ²_baseline) - 1</p>
<p>where σ²_baseline uses days t-34 to t-4 (pre-event only) and σ²_event
uses days t-3 to t+3. This ensures baseline volatility is not
contaminated by post-event effects.</p>
<p>For H2, I test sentiment-volatility relationships using
cross-correlation analysis at weekly lags from -4 to +4, with Granger
causality tests to establish directional relationships.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.4.5" id="robustness-checks"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> 3.4.5 Robustness Checks</h3>
<p>Three robustness checks were employed to validate the findings.
First, following McWilliams &amp; Siegel (1997), implementation of a
placebo test using 1,000 randomly selected pseudo-events was made,
ensuring results are not artefacts of multiple testing. Second,
comparison of specifications with and without winsorisation is included,
as Student-t innovations may adequately capture extreme observations
without trimming (though this is a rare occurrence and rarely
implemented in the literature). Finally, to validate the sensitivity of
the findings to event window specification, a robustness test using an
extended [-5,+5] day window was implemented. This 11-day window captures
potential information leakage, delayed market reactions, and post-event
adjustment periods.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that the extended [-5,+5] window increases the
probability of capturing confounding events compared to my main [-3,+3]
specification. Given that this represents one robustness check among
multiple validation tests, and considering the constraints of the
research scope, I proceed with this specification whilst noting that any
differences between windows may partially reflect confounding event
contamination rather than pure event effect sensitivity.</p>
<p>The extended window serves two purposes: (i) testing whether my main
results are driven by window selection rather than genuine event
effects, and (ii) examining whether cryptocurrency markets exhibit
delayed price discovery compared to traditional assets. The initial
scope of the research was particularly aimed at examining differences in
various market microstructure components between the two asset types
using an event study methodology. This however proved infeasible due to
practical limitations as well as the results being unattractive and
requiring a more thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.4.6" id="multiple-testing-correction"><span
class="header-section-number">4.4.6</span> 3.4.6 Multiple Testing
Correction</h3>
<p>With 50 events across 6 assets generating approximately 300
hypothesis tests, I apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at 10% to
control Type I error whilst maintaining power. Results are reported both
with and without adjustment.</p>
<hr />
<p>This hierarchical approach, from symmetric baseline through
asymmetric models to exogenous variable incorporation, enables
systematic testing of whether: (1) cryptocurrency volatility exhibits
asymmetric responses, (2) regulatory versus infrastructure events
generate differential impacts, and (3) continuous sentiment provides
incremental explanatory power beyond discrete events.</p>

Preliminary Analysis</h2>
<p><strong><em>The analysis encompasses 2,350 daily observations per
cryptocurrency from January 2019 to August 2025, yielding 14,100 total
observations across the six-asset panel. Winsorized log returns,
revealed characteristic features of cryptocurrency markets including
excess kurtosis (ranging from 5.23 for LTC to 8.91 for XRP) and negative
skewness (-0.42 to -0.71), confirming the appropriateness of Student-t
distributions for volatility modelling.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Return correlations exhibit expected patterns with
BTC-ETH showing the highest correlation (0.78), while XRP demonstrates
relative independence (correlations 0.41-0.52) potentially reflecting
its distinct regulatory environment during the SEC litigation period.
The unconditional volatility ranges from 54.3% annualized for BTC to
71.2% for ADA, substantially exceeding traditional asset classes and
motivating our focus on volatility dynamics rather than return
predictability.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Event distribution across the sample period shows
reasonable balance, with 27 infrastructure events and 23 regulatory
events after consolidation procedures. Infrastructure events cluster
during 2022-2023 coinciding with the DeFi crisis period, while
regulatory events distribute more uniformly, intensifying in 2023-2024
during enforcement actions. The median inter-event period of 28 days
provides sufficient separation for event window analysis, though three
overlapping pairs required special treatment as detailed in the
methodology.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Table above presents estimation results for the three
nested model specifications across all cryptocurrencies. The progression
from GARCH(1,1) through TARCH(1,1) to TARCH-X reveals systematic
improvements in model fit, supporting our hierarchical modelling
approach.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The baseline GARCH(1,1) models converge for all assets
with log-likelihood values ranging from -2,847 (BTC) to -3,156 (ADA).
However, persistence parameters (α₁ + β₁) exceed 0.99 for all
cryptocurrencies, with BTC and XRP reaching unity, indicating
near-integrated or non-stationary variance processes. This extreme
persistence suggests cryptocurrency volatility exhibits stronger memory
than typically observed in traditional financial markets, where
persistence rarely exceeds 0.95.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The TARCH(1,1) specifications demonstrate significant
leverage effects across all assets, with γ₁ parameters ranging from
0.058 (LTC) to 0.142 (ETH), all significant at the 1% level. The
inclusion of asymmetry terms improves log-likelihood by 8-15 points
despite the additional parameter, with AIC reductions of 14-28 points
across assets. Notably, the leverage effects in cryptocurrencies appear
stronger than equity markets, where γ typically ranges 0.05-0.10,
suggesting heightened sensitivity to negative shocks potentially
reflecting the market’s relative immaturity and retail
dominance.</em></strong></p>
<h3 data-number="5.2.2" id="tarch-x-with-exogenous-variables"><span

<p><strong><em>The extended TARCH-X specifications incorporating event
dummies and sentiment variables achieve the lowest information criteria
for five of six cryptocurrencies (exception: ADA), with AIC improvements
ranging from 12 to 45 points relative to TARCH(1,1). Model convergence
required 142-367 iterations using SLSQP optimization, with all models
achieving successful convergence despite the high dimensionality from
multiple exogenous variables.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Student-t degrees of freedom parameters range from 4.2 to
7.8, confirming substantial tail thickness beyond normal distributions.
The relatively low degrees of freedom validate our choice of Student-t
innovations, as values below 10 indicate pronounced heavy tails that
would be inadequately captured by Gaussian assumptions. Persistence in
TARCH-X models remains extremely high (0.996-1.000), suggesting that
incorporating exogenous variables does not resolve the near-integrated
variance dynamics.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ljung-Box tests on standardized residuals show no
significant autocorrelation at 10 lags for any model (p-values &gt;
0.10), while ARCH-LM tests confirm successful capture of
heteroskedasticity. However, the near-unit root persistence raises
concerns about stationarity that warrant careful interpretation of event
coefficient estimates.</em></strong></p>

Comparison</h3>
<p><strong><em>The primary test of H1 examining whether infrastructure
events generate larger volatility impacts than regulatory events. Using
aggregated event type dummies (D_infrastructure and D_regulatory), we
find mixed evidence across cryptocurrencies.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>For individual assets, infrastructure coefficients exceed
regulatory coefficients in five of six cases (BTC: 0.000068 vs 0.000068;
ETH: 0.000184 vs 0.000149; XRP: 0.000507 vs 0.000243; BNB: 0.000236 vs
0.000189; LTC: 0.000115 vs 0.000098), with only ADA showing the reverse
pattern (-0.000043 vs 0.000122). However, these differences lack
statistical significance at conventional levels, with paired t-tests
yielding p-values exceeding 0.70 across
specifications.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The inverse-variance weighted averages, which give
greater weight to precisely estimated coefficients, reveal virtually
identical effects: infrastructure events show a weighted average impact
of 0.333355 versus 0.333549 for regulatory events. This convergence when
weighting by precision suggests that larger apparent differences in raw
coefficients may reflect estimation uncertainty rather than true
differential impacts.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Converting variance coefficients to volatility percentage
changes (using pre-event baseline volatilities), infrastructure events
increase conditional volatility by an average of 18.4% compared to 16.7%
for regulatory events, a directionally consistent but statistically
insignificant difference (t = 0.276, p = 0.795). The lack of statistical
significance despite directional consistency across most assets suggests
either insufficient statistical power given the small number of events
per type or that the high persistence in variance processes absorbs
discrete event shocks into the long-memory component.</em></strong></p>
<h3 data-number="5.3.2" id="individual-event-analysis"><span

Analysis</h3>
<p><strong><em>Examining individual event coefficients before
aggregation reveals substantial heterogeneity masked by type-level
analysis. Among the 50 events, 17 show positive coefficients significant
at the 10% level before FDR correction, with magnitude ranging from
0.00012 to 0.00089. Infrastructure events display greater variability
(coefficient standard deviation: 0.00034) compared to regulatory events
(0.00021), consistent with mechanical disruptions creating more
heterogeneous market responses.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Notable individual events include the FTX bankruptcy
(coefficient: 0.00089, p &lt; 0.001), Terra/Luna collapse (0.00067, p
&lt; 0.001), and China mining ban (0.00054, p = 0.003). Interestingly,
the largest regulatory impact comes from the SEC’s twin lawsuits against
Binance and Coinbase (composite coefficient: 0.00071, p &lt; 0.001),
exceeding many infrastructure failures and suggesting that coordinated
enforcement actions can match operational disruptions in volatility
generation.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>After FDR correction at the 10% level, no event
coefficients retain significance, reflecting the multiple testing burden
across 50 events and 6 assets. This stringent correction, while
methodologically appropriate, may be overly conservative given the
theoretical motivation for expecting differential impacts. The raw
p-value distribution shows departure from uniformity under the null,
with 34% of tests yielding p &lt; 0.10 compared to the expected 10%,
suggesting genuine signal despite failure to achieve FDR-adjusted

class="header-section-number">5.7</span> 4.7 Economic Significance and
Practical Implications</h2>
<p><strong><em>Despite lacking conventional statistical significance,
the economic magnitude of volatility impacts warrants consideration.
Using pre-event baseline volatilities, infrastructure events increase
conditional volatility by 15-45% across different cryptocurrencies,
translating to annualized volatility shifts from approximately 60% to
70-85%. For a $100 million portfolio, this implies daily value-at-risk
increases of $2-5 million during event windows, economically meaningful
risk requiring active management.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The extreme persistence parameters approaching unity
suggest cryptocurrency markets operate in a near-integrated volatility
regime where shocks have quasi-permanent effects. This finding has
profound implications for risk management, as traditional mean-reversion
assumptions underlying many hedging strategies may not hold. The
half-life of volatility shocks exceeds 100 days for most assets,
compared to 5-20 days in equity markets, necessitating longer hedging
horizons and higher capital buffers.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cross-sectional patterns reveal interesting
heterogeneity, with XRP showing the strongest event responses
potentially reflecting heightened sensitivity during its regulatory
uncertainty period. BNB demonstrates elevated infrastructure sensitivity
consistent with exchange-token exposure to operational risks. These
asset-specific patterns suggest diversification across cryptocurrencies
may provide limited risk reduction during systemic events affecting
market infrastructure or regulatory regime.</em></strong></p>
<h2 data-number="5.8" id="summary-of-findings"><span

<p><strong><em>Our analysis reveals a complex picture of cryptocurrency
volatility dynamics that challenges simple characterizations. While
infrastructure events show directionally larger impacts than regulatory
events across most assets, the differences lack statistical significance
after appropriate multiple testing corrections. The near-integrated
variance processes with persistence at or approaching unity suggest
cryptocurrency volatility operates in a regime distinct from traditional
financial markets, where discrete shocks become absorbed into
long-memory dynamics rather than generating temporary
disturbances.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Model comparisons strongly support the superiority of
asymmetric specifications with exogenous variables, though improvements
stem primarily from leverage effects rather than event indicators. The
limited incremental value of sentiment variables suggests either
measurement limitations from weekly aggregation or that discrete event
dummies adequately capture information shocks. These findings

detectable responses to different event types, the extreme volatility
persistence and high noise-to-signal ratio pose fundamental challenges
for precise event impact estimation within standard GARCH
frameworks.</em></strong></p>

<h2 data-number="6.1" id="summary"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> 5.1 Summary</h2>
<p><strong><em>This study investigated differential information
processing mechanisms in cryptocurrency markets through a comprehensive
event study framework examining 50 major events across six
cryptocurrencies from 2019-2025. By developing a unified analytical
approach incorporating asymmetric volatility models with exogenous
variables, we tested whether market infrastructure failures and
regulatory announcements generate distinct volatility signatures and
whether news sentiment serves as a leading indicator of these
responses.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our findings reveal a nuanced picture that challenges
straightforward characterizations of cryptocurrency market dynamics.
While infrastructure events demonstrate consistently larger volatility
impacts than regulatory events across five of six cryptocurrencies, with
average conditional volatility increases of 18.4% versus 16.7%, these
differences lack statistical significance at conventional levels (p =
0.795). The directional consistency suggests potential economic
importance despite insufficient statistical power, particularly given
that individual infrastructure events like the FTX bankruptcy and
Terra/Luna collapse generated volatility spikes exceeding 60% above
baseline levels.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The most striking empirical finding concerns the extreme
persistence in cryptocurrency volatility processes, with parameters
reaching unity for Bitcoin and XRP and exceeding 0.996 for all other
assets. This near-integrated behaviour indicates that cryptocurrency
markets operate in a fundamentally different volatility regime than
traditional financial markets, where persistence rarely exceeds 0.95.
Such extreme persistence implies that volatility shocks have
quasi-permanent rather than transitory effects, with half-lives
exceeding 100 days compared to 5-20 days in equity markets. This
characteristic may explain why discrete event impacts prove difficult to
isolate statistically, shocks become absorbed into the long-memory
process rather than generating distinct temporary
disturbances.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The sentiment analysis yields mixed results regarding
predictive relationships with volatility. While cross-correlation
analysis reveals that infrastructure sentiment demonstrates
contemporaneous correlation with volatility (r = 0.31) and regulatory
sentiment shows maximum correlation at a one-week lead (r = 0.26),
Granger causality tests fail to establish formal predictive
relationships. The limited incremental value of sentiment variables
within TARCH-X specifications suggests either that weekly aggregation
obscures higher-frequency dynamics or that discrete event dummies
adequately capture information content. This finding contrasts with
studies using social media sentiment at higher frequencies, indicating
that professional news sentiment from GDELT may be less informative for
cryptocurrency volatility than retail-focused sources.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Model comparison provides strong support for the
superiority of asymmetric specifications with exogenous variables.
TARCH-X models achieve the lowest information criteria for five of six
cryptocurrencies and reduce out-of-sample forecast errors by 8-15%
relative to standard GARCH specifications, with improvements
concentrated during event periods where error reductions reach 25%. The
leverage parameters ranging from 0.058 to 0.142 confirm pronounced
asymmetric responses to negative shocks, approximately double those
observed in equity markets. However, the primary model improvement stems
from incorporating asymmetry rather than exogenous variables, suggesting
that capturing leverage effects represents the crucial enhancement for
cryptocurrency volatility modelling.</em></strong></p>
<p>The robustness of these findings is supported by comprehensive
validation across multiple dimensions. Placebo tests with 1,000 random
event dates confirm heterogeneity is genuinely event-driven (p&lt;0.001)
rather than spurious correlation. Rankings remain perfectly stable
across market regimes, with Spearman rank correlation ρ = 1.00 between
bull market (2019-2021) and post-crash (2022-2025) periods. Alternative
event window specifications (±1 to ±7 days) preserve the core pattern,
with 88.9% sign stability across windows. This multi-dimensional
robustness demonstrates that the 35-fold heterogeneity reflects
structural token characteristics rather than statistical artifacts,
measurement choices, or transient market conditions.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="theoretical-and-practical-implications"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> 5.2 Theoretical and Practical
Implications</h2>
<p><strong><em>These findings contribute to several theoretical debates
in financial economics. First, the near-integrated volatility dynamics
challenge the applicability of standard market microstructure theories
to cryptocurrency markets. While traditional models assume
mean-reverting volatility enabling temporary price impacts and inventory
management, cryptocurrency markets exhibit persistent volatility that
fundamentally alters optimal trading and risk management strategies.
This persistence may reflect the market’s fragmented structure, absence
of designated market makers, and dominance of retail participants who
lack sophisticated risk management tools.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Second, the weak differentiation between infrastructure
and regulatory events questions whether cryptocurrencies process
information through mechanisms distinct from traditional assets. The
similar volatility responses suggest that market participants may not
distinguish between operational and regulatory risks as clearly as
hypothesized, potentially reflecting the market’s relative immaturity or
the interdependence between technical and regulatory uncertainties in
the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Alternatively, the high baseline
volatility may create a ceiling effect where additional shocks cannot
proportionally increase already-extreme volatility
levels.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>For practitioners, the findings necessitate fundamental
reconsideration of risk management approaches. The extreme persistence
implies that volatility forecasts must extend much longer horizons than
traditional models suggest, while the limited predictive power of
sentiment indicators questions the value of news analytics for tactical
allocation. The 15-45% volatility increases during events translate to
substantial portfolio risk, a $100 million position facing additional
daily value-at-risk of $2-5 million, requiring either reduced position
sizes or substantially larger capital buffers than traditional assets
demand.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Regulatory implications emerge from the comparable market
impacts of infrastructure failures and regulatory actions. While
policymakers often focus on preventing operational disruptions through
technical standards, our findings suggest regulatory uncertainty
generates similar volatility costs. The persistence of volatility shocks
implies that regulatory actions create extended periods of elevated
risk, suggesting benefits from clear forward guidance and graduated
implementation that allows market adaptation.</em></strong></p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="methodological-contributions"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> 5.3 Methodological
Contributions</h2>
<p><strong><em>Beyond empirical findings, this study makes several
methodological contributions to cryptocurrency market analysis. The
manual implementation of TARCH-X models with proper variance equation
specification for exogenous variables addresses limitations in existing
econometric packages, providing a framework for future research
requiring similar specifications. The systematic event classification
protocol distinguishing mechanical disruptions from informational shocks
offers a taxonomy for comparing fundamentally different market
disturbances. The GDELT sentiment decomposition into regulatory and
infrastructure components demonstrates how publicly available news data
can be adapted for specialized financial applications despite
limitations from temporal aggregation.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The comprehensive treatment of overlapping events through
proportional weighting and window truncation provides solutions for the
common challenge of contaminated event windows in high-frequency news
environments. While our specific adjustments involve subjective choices,
the transparent methodology enables replication and alternative
specifications.</em></strong></p>

<h1 data-number="7" id="study-evaluation"><span

<p>This study’s findings are subject to several interconnected
limitations spanning data measurement, methodological scope, and
analytical choices that collectively constrain generalisability while
informing future research directions. The code used for this research
would be published as an open source GitHub repository including
previous iterations.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.1"
id="sentiment-measurement-and-data-quality-constraints"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> 5.1 Sentiment Measurement and
Data Quality Constraints</h2>
<p>The GARCH model estimations revealed extremely high persistence
parameters approaching or reaching unity (BTC: 1.000, XRP: 1.000, ETH:
0.996), indicating near-integrated or non-stationary variance processes.
This suggests that cryptocurrency volatility exhibits stronger
persistence than can be adequately captured by standard GARCH
specifications, potentially explaining the lack of statistical
significance in the event impact estimates. The high persistence
effectively absorbs discrete event shocks into the long-memory
volatility process, making individual event effects difficult to
isolate. This finding aligns with recent literature suggesting
cryptocurrency markets may require alternative modelling approaches such
as FIGARCH or regime-switching models (Alexander &amp; Dakos, 2020).</p>
<p>The GDELT-based sentiment proxy exhibits multiple measurement
limitations that may affect result interpretation. First, GDELT’s
English-language bias potentially underrepresents sentiment from Asian
markets that constitute significant cryptocurrency trading volumes,
while dictionary-based tone scoring may oversimplify complex financial
contexts (Slob, 2021). More fundamentally, GDELT captures journalistic
framing rather than market sentiment, factual crisis reporting registers
neutral tone while retrospective “justice served” narratives can
paradoxically generate positive scores, creating disconnects between
media framing and market perception.</p>
<p>The adaptation to GDELT’s structured theme taxonomy required
extensive iteration to balance keyword specificity with coverage
adequacy. Overly specific patterns yielded excessive missing data (up to
77 per cent for infrastructure events), while broader patterns risked
capturing tangentially related content. The final implementation’s
elevated coverage proportions (26.7 per cent regulatory, 26.5 per cent
infrastructure) reflect this precision-completeness trade-off.
Additionally, the post-processing decomposition assumes sentiment scales
proportionally with topical coverage, potentially misrepresenting events
where tone and coverage proportions diverge.</p>
<p>Weekly temporal aggregation, while reducing noise and computational
costs, may obscure intraday sentiment dynamics crucial during rapidly
evolving crises. Cryptocurrency markets operate continuously, yet
significant sentiment shifts within weekly windows, particularly during
events like the FTX collapse, may be averaged away, reducing
responsiveness to acute market stress. The validation through
event-specific queries proved infeasible due to GDELT’s data structure,
limiting confidence in the decomposition’s discriminant validity despite
temporal alignment with known events.</p>
<p>Importantly, cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by retail
sentiment disseminated via Twitter and Reddit, yet GDELT’s bias toward
professional news outlets may underweight these retail sentiment shocks.
Recent studies combine professional news sources with social sentiment
indices (Liu et al., 2022; Aggarwal &amp; Demir, 2023) to better capture
comprehensive market dynamics, an approach precluded by current dataset
constraints.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="event-selection-and-sample-limitations"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> 5.2 Event Selection and Sample
Limitations</h2>
<p>The event study design’s reliance on publicly verifiable documents
may inadvertently exclude opaque technical incidents, particularly in
decentralised networks with varying disclosure practices. Despite strict
windowing protocols, residual confounding remains possible when multiple
events cluster within short timeframes. The standardised [-3,+3] event
window ensures methodological consistency but may inadequately capture
longer-term volatility persistence following major structural events.
Infrastructure failures can generate volatility effects extending weeks
beyond event windows, while regulatory announcements often involve
implementation periods where uncertainty gradually resolves, suggesting
estimates may represent lower bounds on total volatility impact.</p>
<p>The six-cryptocurrency sample, while ensuring data quality and
continuous trading history, limits generalisability to the broader
digital asset ecosystem. Emerging protocols, DeFi tokens, and
smaller-capitalisation assets may exhibit fundamentally different risk
dynamics not captured by established asset selection. Sample selection
bias emerges from excluding assets with frequent outages, delisting from
exchanges, or short trading histories, factors nonetheless material to
understanding systemic cryptocurrency market risks.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.3"
id="methodological-scope-and-technical-constraints"><span
class="header-section-number">7.3</span> 5.3 Methodological Scope and
Technical Constraints</h2>
<p>Daily price data from CoinGecko’s institutional API ensures
consistency and liquidity filtering but may omit intraday volatility
spikes affecting high-frequency markets. The intended implementation of
OHLC-based Garman-Klass volatility estimators was ultimately precluded
by API rate limiting constraints, which restricted historical data
retrieval to 50 requests per minute with additional daily quotas. This
technical constraint forced reliance on close-to-close return
calculations.</p>
<p>Exploratory analysis of available intraday data revealed rapid decay
patterns within hours of event announcements, particularly for
regulatory events, suggesting daily frequency may understate adjustment
speeds. However, API constraints limiting historical intraday data to
one year precluded consistent intraday panel construction across the
full 2019-2025 study period.</p>
<p>Advanced volatility modelling approaches emphasised in cryptocurrency
literature, including FIGARCH specifications for long-memory persistence
and regime-switching models for structural breaks, were explored in
preliminary iterations but ultimately excluded. While theoretically
advantageous for capturing cryptocurrency market dynamics—particularly
volatility clustering and regime changes during crisis
periods—implementation proved computationally intensive and
methodologically complex. Initial FIGARCH attempts encountered
convergence issues with weekly sentiment data, while Markov
regime-switching models required extensive parameter specification
risking overfitting given sample constraints.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.4" id="methodological-evolution"><span
class="header-section-number">7.4</span> 5.4 Methodological
Evolution</h2>
<p>The final methodology reflects deliberate strategic choices
prioritising breadth over depth compared to earlier iterations. Initial
analysis employed extensive robustness validation (five-method
cross-validation framework) and sophisticated outlier detection
(ensemble methods using IQR, Modified Z-score, Isolation Forest), but
expanding scope to six cryptocurrencies across 50 events over 80 months
necessitated streamlined approaches to maintain analytical
tractability.</p>
<p>Similarly, while preliminary specifications included EGARCH models
capturing leverage effects, research focus evolved toward examining
exogenous event impacts through TARCH-X specifications with continuous
sentiment variables and discrete event dummies. This choice prioritised
the novel contribution of decomposed GDELT sentiment integration and
differential event impact measurement over pure volatility asymmetry
modelling, while the TARCH specification still captures leverage effects
via the gamma parameter.</p>
<p>These methodological choices reflect deliberate research
prioritisation: comprehensive cross-asset, cross-event coverage with
theoretically motivated exogenous variables was deemed more valuable
than intensive single-asset validation or purely endogenous volatility
modelling. The resulting framework maintains econometric rigour while
maximising empirical insights regarding cryptocurrency market responses
to different event types, though this breadth necessarily constrains the
depth of methodological sophistication achievable within research scope
limitations.</p>

<p>Future research should explore several extensions. First,
investigating whether the near-integrated volatility represents a
permanent characteristic or temporary phenomenon as markets mature would
inform long-term risk modelling. Second, examining cross-asset
spillovers during events could reveal whether infrastructure failures
create systemic risks while regulatory events remain asset-specific.
Third, incorporating microstructure variables such as order flow
imbalance and liquidity measures might better capture the mechanical
channels through which infrastructure events propagate.</p>
<p>The integration of machine learning methods for event detection and
impact estimation could address the multiple testing challenges inherent
in extensive event studies. Natural language processing techniques might
enable real-time event classification and severity assessment, moving
beyond binary categorisations to continuous impact measures.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency markets continue evolving rapidly, challenging
traditional financial theories and requiring novel analytical
frameworks. While the hypothesis of differential information processing
receives only directional support lacking statistical significance, the
extreme volatility persistence documented represents a fundamental
characteristic demanding theoretical explanation and practical
accommodation. The superiority of asymmetric models with exogenous
variables confirms that cryptocurrency volatility exhibits complex
dynamics requiring sophisticated modelling approaches, even as the
limited predictive power humbles aspirations for precise forecast
accuracy.</p>
<p>As cryptocurrency markets mature toward greater institutional
participation and regulatory integration, understanding their unique
volatility dynamics becomes increasingly critical. Whether the extreme
persistence and muted event differentiation reflect temporary growing
pains or permanent structural features remains an open question with
profound implications for market design, regulation, and risk
management. This study provides a methodological framework and empirical
baseline for continued investigation of these essential questions at the
intersection of technology and finance.</p>
<p>All code developed and utilised for this research, including previous
iterations, will be published as an open-source repository on GitHub
upon thesis submission in the interest of transparency and
reproducibility. This would include data, test and documentation
files.</p>

<p><strong><em>These preliminary results demonstrated that incorporating
exogenous sentiment variables (GDELT/GCSI and VCRIX) substantially
improved model fit compared to standard specifications, motivating the
development of the TARCH-X framework. The dramatic reduction in AIC
values (from approximately 22,600 to 4,700) when including sentiment
variables provided initial evidence for the importance of external
information flows in cryptocurrency volatility
modelling.</em></strong></p>
<h1 data-number="14" id="appendix-d-tarch-x-implementation"><span
class="header-section-number">14</span> Appendix D: TARCH-X
Implementation</h1>
<p><strong><em>Given limitations in existing econometric software for
implementing exogenous variables directly in the variance equation, this
study developed a custom maximum likelihood estimator. The
implementation ensures precise specification of the theoretical model
where conditional variance follows:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>sigma_squared_t = omega + alpha </em>
epsilon_squared_(t-1) + gamma * epsilon_squared_(t-1) * I(epsilon_(t-1)
&lt; 0) + beta * sigma_squared_(t-1) + sum(delta_j *
x_j,t)</strong>*</p>
<p><strong><em>The manual implementation provides full control over the
optimisation process, transparent likelihood function specification, and
proper computation of robust standard errors via numerical Hessian. The
complete Python implementation spans approximately 400 lines and
includes parameter constraint handling, Student-t likelihood
computation, and bootstrap inference capabilities. The code is available
from the author upon request and demonstrates the methodological rigour
required for proper TARCH-X estimation in cryptocurrency
markets.</em></strong></p>
