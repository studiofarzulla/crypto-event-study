## 1. ABSTRACT ENHANCEMENT

### Current Issues:
- Likely focuses on results rather than contribution
- Missing clear research gap
- No mention of policy implications

### Journal-Ready Abstract Structure (250 words):
```
[Research Question & Motivation]
We investigate differential information processing mechanisms in cryptocurrency
markets by examining volatility responses to infrastructure versus regulatory events.

[Research Gap]
While traditional financial theory suggests regulatory interventions create lasting
structural changes, cryptocurrency markets may exhibit 'regulatory resistance' - a
phenomenon unexplored in academic literature.

[Methodology]
Using TARCH-X models with GDELT-derived sentiment indices across 18 major events
and 6 cryptocurrencies (2019-2024), we decompose volatility responses while controlling
for market-wide risk factors.

[Key Findings]
Market structure events (FTX, Terra Luna) generate 2.1x larger volatility impacts
(+31% vs +15%) with significantly longer persistence (14+ days vs 5 days). Only 44%
of events pass placebo tests after FDR correction, with infrastructure failures
dominating the set of statistically significant shocks.

[Contribution]
These findings challenge traditional market microstructure theory and suggest
cryptocurrency markets remain vulnerable to systemic failures while demonstrating
resilience to regulatory attempts at control.

[Implications]
Results inform optimal regulatory timing, cross-border coordination strategies, and
risk management practices in digital asset markets.
