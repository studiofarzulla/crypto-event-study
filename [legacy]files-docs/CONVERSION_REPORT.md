## Conversion Quality Assessment

### ✅ Successfully Converted

1. **Headings:** All heading levels (#, ##, ###) properly formatted
2. **Bold text:** Converted to `**bold**` markdown syntax
3. **Italic text:** Converted to `*italic*` markdown syntax
4. **Bold+Italic:** Converted to `***bold-italic***` markdown syntax
5. **Tables:** Converted to markdown table format with headers and separators
6. **Paragraphs:** Preserved with blank lines between
7. **Section numbers:** Preserved (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 4.6.2)
8. **Greek symbols:** Preserved in text (σ, α, β, γ, ε)
9. **References:** All citations preserved with author names and years
10. **Lists:** Numbered and bulleted lists converted

### ⚠️ Known Issues

#### 1. **Mathematical Equations - INCOMPLETE**

**Problem:** Some inline equations appear as empty placeholders in the text.

**Example:**
```markdown
Line 379: "...where  with  representing event dummies..."
```

**Expected:** Full LaTeX equations like:
```markdown
where $\sigma^2_t = \omega + \alpha_1 \epsilon^2_{t-1} + \beta_1 \sigma^2_{t-1} + \sum_j \theta_j D_{j,t}$ with $D_{j,t}$ representing event dummies
```

**Impact:** Mathematical specifications need manual verification and restoration
**Estimated Count:** Approximately 5-10 equations missing or incomplete

**Locations identified:**
- Line 289: Logarithmic returns formula
- Line 373: TARCH leverage parameter specification
- Line 377: Sentiment proxy variables
- Line 379: TARCH-X specification with exogenous variables
- Line 383: Event coefficient interpretation
- Line 417: Impact calculation formula
- Line 419: Baseline/event variance definition

#### 2. **Word Equation Objects**

Some equations may have been embedded as Word equation objects (MathML/OMML format) which requires specialized parsing. These were not captured by the basic XML text extraction.

**Recommendation:** Cross-reference methodology section (Section 3.3-3.4) with original document to restore equations.

## Tables Converted

The following tables were successfully extracted:

### Coversheet Tables (5 tables - to be removed)
- Disability notice table
- Language modules notice
- Guidelines table
- Marker approaches list
- Academic year table

### Content Tables

1. **Table (Line 227-232):** Literature review comparison
   - Headers: Paper, Assets, Event Types, Window, Sentiment, Volatility Model
   - 4 data rows: Auer & Claessens, Saggu et al., Zhang et al., Caferra & Vidal-Tomás

2. **Table (Line 455-474):** Model comparison table (AIC/BIC/log-likelihood)
   - Headers: crypto, model, AIC, BIC, log_likelihood
   - 6 cryptocurrencies × 3 models = 18 rows
   - Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, LTC, ADA
   - Models: GARCH(1,1), TARCH(1,1), TARCH-X

**All tables:** ✅ Properly formatted with markdown syntax

---

## References Section

✅ **Status:** All references preserved intact

The references section (Section 7, starting line 661) contains extensive academic citations. All author names, years, titles, and publication details were successfully extracted from the DOCX format.

**Estimated reference count:** 100+ citations

---

## Formatting Preservation

### ✅ Preserved Elements

- **Page breaks:** Converted to `---` horizontal rules
- **Emphasis:** Bold, italic, and combined formatting
- **Section numbering:** 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
- **Subscripts/Superscripts:** Partially preserved as Unicode (σ², t-1)
- **Special characters:** Greek letters, mathematical operators
- **Quotation marks:** Preserved
- **Em dashes:** Preserved
- **Parenthetical citations:** (Author, Year) format intact

### ⚠️ Lost Formatting

- **Colors:** Markdown doesn't support colored text
- **Fonts:** All converted to default markdown rendering
- **Font sizes:** Heading hierarchy preserved but not exact sizes
- **Page numbers:** Not applicable in markdown
- **Headers/Footers:** Extracted separately (footer1.xml exists but not integrated)

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### 1. **Remove Coversheets** (High Priority)
Delete lines 1-89 (Coversheet 1), 94-97 (Coversheet 2), and 109-155 (Coversheet 3) to create clean academic document.

### 2. **Restore Equations** (High Priority)
Manually verify and restore mathematical equations in:
- Section 3.3: Data Processing
- Section 3.4: Volatility Modeling Framework
- Section 4: Results (any equation references)

### 3. **Verify Tables** (Medium Priority)
Cross-check that all numerical data in tables matches original:
- Literature review table (line 227)
- Model comparison table (line 455)
- Any appendix tables

### 4. **Format References** (Low Priority - if needed)
References are already extracted. If specific formatting is required (e.g., APA, Chicago), apply consistently.

### 5. **Integrate Robustness Work** (Main Task)
Once coversheets removed and equations verified, integrate additional robustness checks and analysis into appropriate sections.

## Technical Details

### Conversion Method

1. **Extraction:** DOCX unzipped to access XML content (`word/document.xml`)
2. **Parsing:** Python XML parser using `xml.etree.ElementTree`
3. **Processing:** Custom logic for:
   - Paragraph styles → Markdown headings
   - Text runs → Bold/italic formatting
   - Tables → Markdown table syntax
   - Page breaks → Horizontal rules
4. **Output:** Clean markdown with structural annotations

### Files Generated

- `/home/kawaiikali/event-study/dissertation-original.md` - Main output
- `/home/kawaiikali/event-study/temp_docx_extract/` - Temporary XML extraction (can be deleted)
- `/home/kawaiikali/event-study/convert_docx.py` - Converter script (kept for reference)

## Conclusion

The DOCX to Markdown conversion was **highly successful** for the vast majority of content. The document structure, all prose text, tables, references, and basic formatting have been accurately preserved in markdown format.

**Critical Action Required:**
- Restore 5-10 mathematical equations in methodology section
- Remove 3 coversheets (clearly marked in output)

**Ready for:** Integration of robustness work once equations verified and coversheets removed.
