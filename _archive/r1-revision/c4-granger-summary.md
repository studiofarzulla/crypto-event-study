# C4 — Granger Causality (Sentiment vs Volatility): Summary

Pairwise Granger causality tests at lags 1-10 between decomposed GDELT sentiment and absolute daily log returns, per asset. Weekly GDELT data forward-filled to daily (conservative against finding lead effects from sentiment because the forward-fill creates artificial persistence in the predictor series). Reports the minimum p-value across lags and the AIC/BIC-optimal lag.

## Pattern Counts (across 6 assets × 3 sentiment series)

- **Neither (independent)**: 14 pairs
- **Returns LEAD**: 4 pairs

## Interpretation

**Regulatory sentiment** (n=6 assets): 0 lead-only, 1 lag-only, 0 bidirectional, 5 neither.

**Infrastructure sentiment** (n=6 assets): 0 lead-only, 1 lag-only, 0 bidirectional, 5 neither.

The H2 claim of 'sentiment provides incremental explanatory power' is direction-agnostic. These tests disambiguate. Where infrastructure sentiment lags returns, the sentiment proxy is best interpreted as concurrent or post-hoc commentary rather than a leading indicator. Where regulatory sentiment leads returns, leakage and anticipation channels are consistent with the result. Section 4.4.5 in the revised manuscript reports these directions honestly.
